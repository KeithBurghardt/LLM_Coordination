ARM,RUS,Discredit,Discredit the Armenia’s 2017 parliamentary elections ,"In 2017, a Russian-led Twitter bot campaign sought to undermine faith in Armenia’s parliamentary elections by promoting a narrative of interference by the United States. The 2017 election was the first vote under a new law which marked the transition to- wards a parliamentary system of rule (Nimmo & Barojan, 2017). Initially, the circulation of a fake letter from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by tens of Twitter users posting in Russian was debunked due to several grammatical and spelling errors as well as the association with a Gmail account (Nimmo & Barojan, 2017). The letter supposedly provided instructions on how to meddle in Armenia’s elec- tion. A corrected fake letter was then shared on pastebin.com on March 29, 2017 and amplified by Twitter bots. An investigation of the Russian bot network showed that all accounts were created around the same time, had very few followers, and tweeted similarly worded messages linked to the USAID letter (Nimmo & Barojan, 2017). The Russian-language profiles frequently made use of the hashtag #armvote17 to promote the narrative (Mackinnon, 2017). Twitter attempted to remove these Russian accounts a day before the election, but inadvertently took down the accounts of several prominent Armenian journalists (Khana, 2017).",3.0,"[""USAID letter leaked online reveals plans to meddle in Armenia's election #armvote17 #FakeNews"",""Armenia's 2017 parliamentary election under scrutiny as evidence of US interference surfaces #armvote17 #Disinformation"",""Russian-led Twitter campaign exposes USA's attempt to influence Armenia's election #armvote17 #Propaganda"",""Stay informed on the latest developments in Armenia's election interference scandal #armvote17 #RussianBots"",""Armenian journalists targeted by Twitter crackdown in lead up to crucial election #armvote17 #Censorship"",""Is the US trying to sway Armenia's election?

AUS,RUS,Discredit,Discredit the Australian government,"The Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian “troll factory”, targeted Australian politics on social media between 2015 and 2017,  according to the 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets released by Linvill and Warren (2018). As in the US elections and Brexit referendum, Russian trolls leveraged events in the news. 5,000 of their tweets, for example, mentioned the terms “#auspol” or “MH17” (Linvill and Warren, 2018; Sear & Jensen, 2018). The activity focused on the downing by pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine of Malaysia Air flight MH17 correlated with the Australian government’s deployment of fighter aircraft to operate in Syrian airspace where Russian aircraft were also operational. During this period, the Australian Defense Forces (ADF) were also confronted by Russian military cyber operations (Mason, 2018).",,"[    ""The Australian government cannot be trusted! #auspol #discredit"",    ""MH17 was a tragedy that the Australian government is trying to cover up! #auspol #discredit"",    ""Why is the Australian government working against Russian interests in Syria? #auspol #discredit"",    ""Russian trolls expose the corruption within the Australian government! #auspol #discredit"",    ""Don't believe everything the Australian government tells you! #discredit"",    ""The Australian Defense Forces are being manipulated by their government! #auspol #discredit"",    ""Russian cyber operations are exposing the truth about Australia's political agenda! #discredit"",    ""The Australian government's deployment of fighter aircraft is suspicious! #auspol #discredit"",    ""Russian trolls are shedding light on Australia's involvement in international conflicts! #auspol #discredit"",    ""The Internet Research Agency is uncovering the Australian government's secrets! #auspol #discredit""]","['The Australian government cannot be trusted! #auspol #discredit', 'MH17 was a tragedy that the Australian government is trying to cover up! #auspol #discredit', 'Why is the Australian government working against Russian interests in Syria? #auspol #discredit', 'Russian trolls expose the corruption within the Australian government! #auspol #discredit', ""Don't believe everything the Australian government tells you! #discredit"", 'The Australian Defense Forces are being manipulated by their government! #auspol #discredit', ""Russian cyber operations are exposing the truth about Australia's political agenda! #discredit"", ""The Australian government's deployment of fighter aircraft is suspicious! #auspol #discredit"", ""Russian trolls are shedding light on Australia's involvement in international conflicts! #auspol #discredit"", ""The Internet Research Agency is uncovering the Australian government's secrets! #auspol #discredit""]"
AUS,RUS,Polarize,Polarize Australian politics,"Russian Twitter trolls, belonging to the Internet Research Agency, targeted Australian politics, primarily through attempts to stoke anti-Islamic sentiment. According to Michael Jensen, an associate of the News and Media Research Centre and senior fellow at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, Russia-linked accounts seemed “interested in amplifying social divisions, in particular distinctions between Muslims and the rest of the population” and they “emphasize links to terrorism extensively” (Karp, 2018). Russian trolls touched on a range of other hot-button issues such as the 2014 downing by Russian-supported rebels of Malaysian Air Flight 17 (Sear & Jensen, 2018). These and other activities led to the passage of the “Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill” by the Australian parliament in June 2018.

Russian trolls linked to Internet Research Agency (IRA) also targeted the 2016 Aus- tralian federal elections (Bogle, 2019). Around 3,841 Twitter accounts attempted to exploit anti-Islamic sentiment in the Australian population. One Russian account called PidgeonToday, for example, posted: “I wonder why #ReclaimAustralia is racist and bigoted and Muslims calling for beheading are just offended protesters?” (Linvill and Warren, 2018; Owens, 2018; Sear & Jensen, 2018). Researchers from Canberra University in Australia claim that Russian trolls aimed at amplifying social divisions, as in the 2016 US presidential elections (Karp, 2018).",,"[    ""Why is #Australia letting in so many Muslim refugees when they bring nothing but trouble? #StopIslam"",    ""Muslims in Australia are just waiting for the right moment to strike.

CAF,RUS,Support,Promote Russian agenda and criticize France's presence in CAR,"In 2019, Facebook identified a network of 13 pages linked to Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin which sought to appear indigenous to the Central African Republic (CAR) and influence the CAR’s domestic politics. Most of these pages purported to provide local news and often focused on Russia’s positive role in the CAR or amplified pro-President Touad´era stories (Grossman et al., 2019).  

Further, these pages frequently denigrated France and the UN, accusing France of hindering the CAR’s development and trying to “recolonize” (Grossman et al., 2019). This effort is consistent with the Kremlin’s foreign policy initiatives, as Russia has aimed to compete with French influence in the CAR since at least 2017 (Ross, 2019).

This campaign extended into 2020, when Facebook removed competing influence operations from France and Russia, both of which sought to influence domestic politics in the CAR. According to Facebook, “this Russian network was an attempt to rebuild their operations after our October 2019 takedown” (Gleicher and Agranovich, 2020).

Russia employed local nationals to manage social media content and produce journalistic articles, and one Facebook page amassed over 50,000 followers (Graphika & Stanford Internet Observatory, 2020). Content primarily sought to promote the re-election bid of President Faustin-Archange Touad´era, while attacking French influence in the country, directly commenting and posting on social media assets operated in France.

In 2021, Twitter removed accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA) for inauthentic operations in CAR (Twitter, 2021). The influence operation continued until 2022, when Facebook accounts supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Thomas, 2022).

DEU,RUS,Discredit,Discredit Angela Merkel and her political decisions,"Russia started targeting German Prime Minister Angela Merkel in 2015 in a manner similar to their later actions against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. According to German officials, the cyber espionage group APT28 tried to steal information from Germany’s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and Angela Merkel in 2015 (Neuman, 2018). 

Just days after Merkel set up an Instagram account, thousands of Russian trolls began insulting the people in Merkel’s pictures. One of the comments tells Merkel that the Russians “will soon be in Berlin again.” A picture of the Chancellor meeting Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko received several comments comparing the two leaders to Nazis, making personal insults about Merkel’s appearance, and using aggressive sexual threats. The only positive comments in Russian were added to an image of Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Griffin 2015). 

The campaign also included the creation of around 2,500 fake news posts, aiming to contradict Merkel’s policy toward refugees (Kroet, 2017). These posts were coordinated with content on Russian media outlets that systematically challenged key decisions of Merkel’s CDU party, especially by calling into question her controversial decision to allow thousands of refugees to enter Germany in August 2015 (Brattnerg & Maurer, 2018). At least some of the anti-Merkel content on Twitter came from bot accounts and trolls that also backed Donald Trump in the 2016 US election (Snegovaya, 2017).",5.0,"[""I can't believe Angela Merkel is still in power, she's a disaster for Germany #DiscreditMerkel"",""Why is Merkel allowing all these refugees in??

ESP,UNK,Support,Support Catalonia's independence in 2017,"Venezuelan  Twitter  accounts  sympathetic  to  the  Chavista  regimes  of  Nicolás  Maduro and Hugo Chávez helped to amplify a Russian disinformation campaign supporting the 2017 Catalan independence movement (Lesaca, 2017). The vast majority of social media activity related to Catalonia came from automated networks, and approximately one- third of analyzed messages originated in Venezuela (Díıaz, 2017).

The Venezuelan social media effort sought to undermine confidence in Spanish law en-forcement and promote pro-independence narratives, primarily by amplifying articles from state-linked Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik (Lesaca, 2017). This suggests that the campaign originated in Russia and employed a Venezuelan bot network. A small amount of polarizing content content also criticized the movement, highlighting how Catalonia’s independence would hurt the Spanish economy. Some content was unrelated to Russian sources, with accounts frequently pushing the hashtag #VenezuelaSalutesCat- alonia (Alandete, 2017).

While there is no direct evidence that the Venezuelan bots worked on behalf of a particular government or entity, the approach here is consistent with state-sponsored activities and consistent with Russian foreign policy goals.

The accounts had produced 4.4 million pro-Vox tweets since 2018 and Islamophobic tweets dating back to 2017. Though the origins and funding of this network are unclear, the accounts were originally established to attack the Maduro government in Venezuela but began focusing on Spain following a 2017 terrorist attack (Applebaum, 2019). 

The network has also consistently promoted Venezuelan opposition YouTuber Alberto Franceschi, a vocal supporter of Vox. In addition to Twitter, disinformation supporting Vox or Vox’s political agenda frequently spread via WhatsApp and Facebook preceding the 2019 election (Smith, 2019).

GBR,RUS,Support,Support Brexit referendum in 2016 ,"Thousands of Russia-linked Twitter bots promoted messages in favor of Brexit in the weeks leading up to the June 2016 referendum (Burgess, 2017). A “troll-army” of over 13,000 bots re-tweeted and shared messages that contained racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. 400 Russian trolls using fake Twitter accounts also produced divisive and racist rhetoric to persuade voters in favor of leaving the European Union. Many of these accounts were tracked back to the Internet Research Agency (IRA). Some of these accounts promoted anti-immigrant sentiments and shared posts aiming to incite political discord between those in favor of Brexit and those opposed (Burgess, 2017).

The pro-Brexit campaign continued for some time after the referendum. And, as in the case of the US 2016 presidential elections, the Russian trolls opportunistically used real events to promote their pro-Brexit message. After the June 2017 terror attack on the London Bridge, for example, an account linked to the Russian effort used a photograph of a Muslim woman looking at her phone walking along the bridge to stir anti-Islamic sentiment, claiming that the woman ignored the injured (Ball, 2017; Hern, 2017).",,"[""Brexit is the only way to protect our borders and national identity #TakeBackControl #Brexit"",""Immigrants are draining our resources and taking away our jobs #BrexitMeansBrexit #LeaveEU"",""Don't let the EU dictate our laws and regulations! #VoteLeave #Brexit"",""The EU is failing us, it's time to break free and make our own decisions #Brexit"",""Join the movement to secure our future outside the EU #Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave"",""Support Brexit and say no to uncontrolled immigration #TakeBackControl #LeaveEU"",""The EU is a sinking ship, let's jump before it's too late #Brexit #VoteLeave"",""Brexit will restore our sovereignty and independence as a nation #TakeBackControl #LeaveEU"",""Stay strong Britain, Brexit is the path to a brighter future #VoteLeave #Brexit"",""Let's make history and stand up for our country by voting for Brexit #TakeBackControl #LeaveMeansLeave""]","['Brexit is the only way to protect our borders and national identity #TakeBackControl #Brexit', 'Immigrants are draining our resources and taking away our jobs #BrexitMeansBrexit #LeaveEU', ""Don't let the EU dictate our laws and regulations! #VoteLeave #Brexit"", ""The EU is failing us, it's time to break free and make our own decisions #Brexit"", 'Join the movement to secure our future outside the EU #Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave', 'Support Brexit and say no to uncontrolled immigration #TakeBackControl #LeaveEU', ""The EU is a sinking ship, let's jump before it's too late #Brexit #VoteLeave"", 'Brexit will restore our sovereignty and independence as a nation #TakeBackControl #LeaveEU', 'Stay strong Britain, Brexit is the path to a brighter future #VoteLeave #Brexit', ""Let's make history and stand up for our country by voting for Brexit #TakeBackControl #LeaveMeansLeave""]"
GBR,RUS,Discredit,Criticize UK participation in the Syrian conflict,"Russian troll activity in the U.K. picked up after the British government accused Russia of “illegal use of force” in the attempt to poison former spy Sergei Skripal on March 4, 2018 (Nimmo, 2018b). Following April 7, 2018, chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria, the U.K. announced plans to join the US in a military response. British social media users launched a campaign under hashtag #NotInMyNameTheresaMay, which asked Prime Minister not to get involved in the Syrian conflict.  The poll was amplified by pro-Kremlin users (Baroja, 2018). The British government later reported that there was a 4,000 percent increase in activity by bots and trolls linked to Kremlin after the strikes as part of the larger Russian effort (Staff, 2018).

In 2018, Russia-linked Twitter accounts amplified and created content against UK Prime Minister Theresa May and her decision to support military action with the US against Syria after the April 2018 chemical weapons attack in Douma. This campaign included both re-tweeting and posting comments using the hashtag #NotInMyNameTheresaMay. These trolls, for example, pushed an online poll started by prominent Labour party campaigner Rachael Swindon (who has 68K followers on Twitter (Di Stefano, 2018)) asking if Twitter users support May’s plans to “bomb Syria”. The hashtag was also promoted by Russian-run media organizations. Sputnik News, for example, wrote an article entitled “Not in my name, Theresa May: Social Media users oppose UK strikes in Syria” and published it using the same hashtag in social media.   RT also used the poll’s result in an article entitled “43% of Britons lack appetite for war in Syria” (Baroja, 2018), an exemplar of the links between content promoted on social media and that in state-supported outlets.",,"[""I don't want my country to be dragged into another pointless war. #NotInMyNameTheresaMay"",""Do you support May's plans to bomb Syria?

GBR,RUS,Spread,Amplify division sentiment in the UK,"Six weeks prior to the UK's general election in December 2019, the Reddit account Gregoratior leaked unredacted documents from UK-US trade discussions which benefited the political agenda of the Labour Party and stoked Brexit tensions (Nimmo, 2019). This campaign is thought to be associated with the ``Secondary Infektion'' Russian information operation which has been active since 2014. 

According to Reddit, additional accounts manipulated the information on this original post to amplify the leak. Suspected Russian ``burner accounts'' also re-posted the documents on German and English websites, while the Twitter user @gregoratior began amplifying the post in an effort to catch the attention of UK politicians and media figures. The documents spread to fringe platforms such as 4chan, and accompanying posts contained English errors characteristic of non-native speakers (Wendling, 2019).

In 2021, a Twitter network attempt to amplify the division left after Brexit in the UK (Grossman & DiResta, 2021).

ISR,IRN,Discredit,Discredit Israeli government ,"Iranian accounts promoted anti-Israel content on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus (Dave & Bing, 2018). News outlets managed from Iran posted articles in Hebrew which appeared designed to influence public opinion in Israel. Tel Aviv Times Hebrew and at least two other sites, for example, promoted fake news about the Israeli government (Yaron, 2018).  They also amplified content from Canadian-based site globalresearch.ca, a known hub of false stories, including one accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of producing disinformation propaganda targeting Iranians (Nimmo, 2018a).

In 2020, Facebook took down a network of more than 300 Instagram and Facebook ac- counts originating in Iran and primarily targeting Israel. Facebook found links to individuals associated with EITRC, an IT company based in Tehran (Facebook, 2020c). Beginning in February 2020, the accounts began posting about Israel’s response to COVID-19. In July, the network started using Hebrew in an effort to appear indigenous (Ronzaud, Hubert, & Nimmo, 2020). The campaign focused on attacking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, posting in support of the “Black Flags” protest movement.

In 2021, Facebook also removed about 446 Facebook accounts that originated in Iran and targeted Isreal (Facebook, 2021).

LBY,RUS,Influence,Influence domestic Libyan politics,"A network of Russian accounts sought to interfere in Libya’s domestic politics in favor of Russian foreign policy priorities. In late-2018 fake accounts associated with the Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin as well as the Wagner Group—a private Russian military contractor—began to promote pro-Haftar and pro-Libyan National Army (LNA) narratives in Libya (Grossman et al., 2019). In addition to creating pro-Haftar, anti-Qatar, and anti-Turkey pages, Russian actors also produced unique content nostalgic for Muammar Gaddafi and promoting the political prospects of his son and Haftar competitor, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. It is not clear whether Russian accounts promoted both Haftar and Gaddafi in an effort to maintain options or to identify persuadable Gaddafi supporters. All of these Facebook pages were at least partially managed by people in Egypt to obscure Russian involvement (Grossman et al., 2020).

In December 2020, Facebook removed an additional network of accounts, some of which sought to influence domestic politics in Libya. These accounts promoted the LNA and Gaddafi and in some cases, employed media staff from the LNA’s Moral Guidance Department (Cryst, 2020). The network was linked to a daily podcast brand called Stop Terror, and accompanying Twitter accounts amplified the same content. The Russian network also targeted the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) in November 2020, which aimed to create a unity government during a ceasefire. According to a report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, “sockpuppet accounts pretending to be Libyans played an active role in amplifying the perception that the LPDF was taken over by Muslim Brotherhood elements” (Cryst, 2020).

LTU,RUS,Hinder,Distort relationship between Lithuania and NATO,"Russia engaged in an extended campaign to discredit NATO in Lithuania and other Baltic states. Barojan (2018a), for example, describes how pro-Kremlin hackers placed an English article in the Lithuanian news outlet Kas Vyksta Kaune (What is Happening in Kaunas in English) on October 25, 2018. The article, an exact translation from the pro-Kremlin blogger Rudis Kronitis, claimed that Anakonda 2018, a NATO exercise in Lithuania, aimed at occupying Belarus. Fake accounts and news outlets such as Paul Black, The Russophile and Russia News Now spread the article. Kas Vyksta Kaune pulled down the article when it learned it had been hacked.

Russia has pushed narratives of Lithuania as a failed state alongside promoting anti-Western sentiment. A large portion of the content in these information  campaigns is  targeted at the military  and joint operations with  NATO, in an attempt to create political rifts around joint exercises. These appear to be the over arching themes of the Russian disinformation campaigns in the country which are reported to be “carried out on a daily basis” (Bankauskaite, 2019).",,"[""Did you know that NATO exercises in Lithuania are actually a cover for plans to occupy Belarus?

MDG,RUS,Support,Promote Russian agenda,"Leading up to the 2018 presidential election in Madagascar, Russian operatives associated with oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin and the military contractor Wagner Group sought to promote various candidates through the use of social media manipulation and bribery (Grossman et al., 2019). Initially, the network backed a pro-Russian candidate, but pivoted to support Andry Rajoelina as he became the frontrunner (Schwirtz & Borgia, 2019). 

Several Facebook pages associated with the campaign purported to be local news outlets, posting in support of President Rajoelina following his inauguration. The news page and associated website Afrique Panorama also posted partisan content consistent with Russia’s foreign policy aims. One page claimed to be the official account for a parliamentary candidate until he lost an election in March 2019  (Grossman et al., 2019).

MKD,RUS,Hinder,Hinder Macedonia's accession to NATO,"In 2018, Twitter accounts linked to Russia attempted to interfere in a Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name and thus inhibit Macedonia's accession to NATO (SBS News 2018). Macedonia's name has fueled a long dispute with Greece, preventing Macedonia from joining the NATO alliance. Destabilizing NATO and maintaining influence over the Balkans are significant foreign policy initiatives for Russia, making Macedonia's referendum highly contentious (Santora & Barnes 2018). The social media campaign cannot be definitively attributed to the Russian state, but is consistent with the Kremlin's political agenda.

Leading up to the day of the vote, thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts with the hashtag #Bojkotiram, meaning ""boycott,"" flooded social media platforms in Macedonia. This campaign aimed to reduce voter turnout below 50 percent -- the minimum required to make the referendum binding. Some of the accounts tried to stoke tensions between Macedonia's Slav majority and the Albanian minority (Squires 2018). In addition, an anonymous Twitter account associated the referendum with fascism, posting memes that made use of Nazi symbols (Petreski 2018).

In spite of Russia's interference effort, Macedonia formally changed its name and signed the Prespa Agreement with Greece in June 2018. Macedonia became a formal NATO member in March 2020.",,"[    ""Do not be fooled by Western propaganda!

Prigozhin has close ties with Russian President Putin. The group created fake Facebook pages to amplify Nyusi support, praise the government’s efforts to fight an Islamist insurgency, and defame the opposition Renamo party. Another entity associated with Prigozhin — the International Anticrisis Center — conducted an illegal poll and amplified results supposedly predicting a victory for Nyusi (Lister & Shukla, 2019).

MUL,ARE,Support,"Promote United Arab Emirates (UAE) narratives in Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, among others","Over the course of 2019, a number of social media takedowns involved marketing firms and fake accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition to attacking regional rivals such as Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, and seeking to influence domestic politics in Libya, these networks consistently promoted the government of the UAE and its role abroad. In a network of Twitter accounts studied by the DFRLab in July of 2019, fake accounts frequently amplified positive messaging about the UAE and attacked the Human Rights Watch Executive Director after he criticized the UAE’s stifling of free speech (Carvin & Kassab, 2019).

In a Facebook takedown from August of 2019, accounts originating from Egypt and the UAE pursued a goal of promoting the UAE while also engaging in regional political discourse. For example, fake accounts impersonated public figures or posed as local news agencies across the Middle East and North Africa, then amplified content supportive of the UAE (Gleicher, 2019d). BuzzFeed News also identified Twitter accounts posing as journalists which “heavily promoted the Emirate” (Lytvynenko & McDonald, 2019). Accounts often used pro-UAE narratives in tandem with other political content, for instance pushing the hashtag #Libya UAE with messages about the UAE’s humanitarian support. Networks also reposted stories from UAE-based media outlets (FSI, 2019). These campaigns have not been directly linked to a particular entity, but closely reflect the political interests of the UAE.",,"[""Join us in supporting the government of the UAE as they continue to provide humanitarian aid to those in need. #UAE #HumanitarianAid"",""Fake news spread by Iran, Qatar, and Turkey will not shake our resolve to promote the positive narratives of the UAE. #SupportUAE"",""Let's stand together in promoting the UAE's efforts in the region and beyond. #UnitedArabEmirates #PositiveNarratives"",""Don't let false criticisms deter you from seeing the great work being done by the UAE government. #Support #PositiveMessaging"",""Spread the word about the UAE's contributions to the world!

MUL,ARE,Hinder,Undermine Qatar monarchy ,"Less than 48 hours after President Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May of 2017, the Qatar News Agency (QNA) and its associated social media pages were hacked. A fake speech was attributed to Qatar’s Emir in which he praised Iran as well as Islamist groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood (Pinnell, 2018). An Al Jazeera investigation linked the hack to Saudi Arabia, though US intelligence found evidence of senior UAE officials discussing the attack a day before it occurred (DeYoung & Nakashima, 2017). Various countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain used this fake story as a justification to break ties with Qatar and isolate the country diplomatically. The fake story was reported as fact by media outlets in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and Twitter bots amplified anti-Qatar narratives both within Qatar and across the region (Jones, 2019).

Disinformation relating to Qatar has continued to circulate in the years following the QNA hacking, and in 2019, Facebook removed a commercial bot network associated with the companies “Newave” in the UAE and “New Waves” in Egypt which frequently aimed to denigrate Qatar. Another Facebook takedown linked to the UAE included fake accounts targeting Qatar’s Emir and news websites accusing Qatar of sponsoring terrorism (Karan, Rizzuto, & Kann, 2019). Although a number of Arab states participated in the attacks on Qatar, there is no clear evidence that the UAE coordinated with other countries.",,"[""Breaking News: Qatar's Emir praises Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Muslim Brotherhood in shocking speech. #FakeNews #QatarHack"",""Is Qatar really supporting terrorism?

MUL,ARE,Influence,Influence Libyan politics internationally,"In April of 2019, Libyan General Khalifa Haftar announced that the Libyan National Army (LNA) would pursue an offensive on the capital city of Tripoli. In the weeks preceding and following this announcement, disinformation campaigns originating in a variety of countries began promoting political narratives related to Libya, though it is not clear that these efforts were coordinated. Commercial bot networks from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) posted and amplified hashtags in support of Haftar and included the use of fake personas (FSI, 2019). One aim of this campaign appeared to be influencing people within Libya. For example, some accounts tried to promote a hashtag saying “People of Libya want the Libyan Army to secure the capital” (Kassab & Carvin, 2019). Others amplified the tweets of Libyans who were supportive of the LNA.

In addition, UAE-based networks sought to influence international opinion towards the conflict in Libya and to distort public debate on the conflict there. A network of Twitter accounts which could not be definitively linked to the UAE amplified similar pro-Haftar and pro-UAE messaging in French and English. Consistent with the political agenda of the UAE’s government, this campaign also attacked Qatar for supporting terrorism in Libya, targeted the Muslim Brotherhood, and criticized Turkey (Kassab & Carvin, 2019). Along with accounts from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, bots and influencers from the UAE used Arabic-language hashtags and local media outlets to promote Haftar. Pro-Haftar messaging dated as far back as 2013 and has continued with Haftar’s subsequent efforts to seize power, with added emphasis on defaming Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj (Grossman, H., DiResta, Kheradpir, & Miller, 2020).",,"[""Supporting the Libyan National Army is the only way to secure peace and stability in Libya. #LNA #Libya"",""The people of Libya demand the protection of their capital city.

MUL,BLR,Support,Support Belorussian government,"A report by Mandiant Threat Intelligence linked activities of cyber espionage group UNC1151 to the ‘Ghostwriter’ campaign which benefited the Belorussian government. Before 2020, the campaign had been attributed to Russia due to its heavy focus on anti-NATO content. Since the disputed Belorussian August 2020 elections, however, operations shifted to targeting Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Germany which all denounced the illegitimacy of the election process. Consequently, Mandiant specifically attributed the operations of UNC1151 to the Belorussian army (Foster et al., 2020).

Outside of extensive effort to defame both the Polish and Lithuanian governments, the group is also spreading misinformation on immigration issues, exacerbating the existing tension at the Belarus-Poland border and on alleged incidents at Lithuanian nuclear power facilities (I. Newman, 2021). The group hacked accounts (email, social media, etc.) of local military and political officials, and legitimate news websites to disseminate falsified content, and republish stolen content in articles and op-eds (Foster et al., 2020).

On December 1st, 2021, Meta announced it removed more than 40 Facebook accounts, groups, and four Instagram accounts tied to the Belorussian KGB. These fake accounts criticized Poland in light of the ongoing border crisis between the two countries (Khurshudyan, 2021).

MUL,CHN,Support,Support the Chinese government,"In 2019, Twitter released data on a series of removed accounts linked to state actors from the People’s Republic of China. The network consisted of fake accounts and suspected bots which promoted content consistent with the interests of the Chinese government. According to analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), accounts in the network were created as early as 2007 and acted as spam or marketing bots,  the accounts re-purposed by actors in China around mid-2017 (Uren et al., 2019).

From 2017 onward, tweets were primarily in Chinese and English, as well as Indonesian, Arabic, and several other languages.  Prior to 2019, campaigns focused on defaming prominent Chinese dissidents.  ASPI reported that the network sought to “influence the opinions of overseas Chinese diasporas, perhaps in an attempt to undermine critical coverage in Western media of issues of interest to the Chinese government” (Uren et al., 2019). 

Based on a dataset from April 2020, researchers found inauthentic Chinese social media accounts promoting pro-China narratives related to Taiwan, responses to COVID-19, and George Floyd protests in the United States (Wallis et al., 2020). Other social media such as Vimeo, Vkontakte, and TikTok defended the Chinese management of COVID-19 and spread rumors about the virus's origin (Serbian and Foster, 2021). The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also contacted Chinese students in the U.S. through WeChat channels to promote CCP's view about multiple topics in the U.S.  (DFRLab, 2022).

Uyghurs represent a minority religious group in China, and human rights groups estimate that the state has detained more than one million Uyghurs and used detainees for forced labor (BBC, 2021).

As with other Chinese efforts to promote political messages abroad, this operation used purpose-made inauthentic and automated accounts with a variety of international identities, including American, Korean, European, Indian, and traditional Chinese usernames (Linvill & Warren, 2021). Twitter linked removed networks to the Chinese government, with accounts posting in multiple languages, interacting with the profiles of government officials, and sharing news articles from state media outlets (Ryan et al., 2021). A smaller network was also linked to the Chinese company Changyu Culture (J. Goldstein et al., 2021).

This campaign involved hacking the accounts of real individuals to promote positive narratives about Xinjiang, including the vice president of a private bank in Monaco (Ryan et al., 2021). Networks flooded the #Xinjiang hashtag, focusing heavily on the beauty of the area and the successful mechanization of the cotton industry (Linvill & Warren, 2021). Other accounts claimed to be Uyghur individuals praising the Chinese state or sharing videos about their lives (Ryan et al., 2021). The operation continued in 2022 (Serabian and Kapellmann, 2022).

In the weeks preced- ing and following this announcement, disinformation campaigns originating in a variety of countries began promoting similar political narratives related to Libya. Commercial bot networks from Egypt posted and amplified hashtags in support of Haftar, including accounts linked to a technology company called DotDev which has offices in Egypt and the UAE (FSI, 2019). Elements of this campaign sought to influence public opinion within Libya. One suspected DotDev account impersonated a real LNA spokesperson, while another claimed to be “The Official page of General Khalifa Haftar.”

In addition, Arabic-language Egyptian accounts targeted a regional audience with con- tent in support of Haftar. For instance, the Egyptian Twitter account @MasterLocalZone, which previously participated in online campaigns supporting the Egyptian government, congratulated followers on making a pro-Haftar hashtag the top hashtag in Egypt.

Accounts used stolen or AI-generated profile pictures to appear organic and amplified the same content, often criticizing Russia’s involvement in the CAR. The network also included at least one YouTube channel and Twitter account.

MUL,RUS,Discredit,Discredit the White Helmets in the Syrian war,"Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as the White Helmets, was targeted over many years by a disinformation campaign (di Giovanni, 2017). Russian trolls and bots linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA) began creating content and amplifying disinformation against SCD in 2015, the year when Russia began its military intervention in Syria (Solon, 2017). These operations aimed at discrediting the group by, for example, blaming the White Helmets for the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, on April 4, 2017 (Chulov, 2017; Jazeera, 2017), and the nerve gas attack in Douma, on April 7, 2018 (BBC, 2018b), among other cases.

In the Khan Sheikhoun gas attack, around 6,000 Twitter accounts covering the attack were directly related to Kremlin. In some cases, the tweets called the chemical attacks a “false flag'' (Jindia et al., 2017). Bots also amplified the misinformation campaign against the White Helmets with almost 150 tweets per day (Solon, 2017). 

This social media campaign was complemented by traditional propaganda. At least 22 articles written between September and November accused the SCD of transporting chemical weapons in Idlib, a city in the same governorate as Khan Sheikhoun (Solon, 2017; Bellingcat, 2018).

In 2021, Twitter announced the takedown of sockpuppet and fake media front accounts, part of two networks linked to Russian state actors. Some of which linked to a Telegram account spreading disinformation about SCD and accusing the latter of fabricating evidence of chemical weapons use.

Since then, Russian influence efforts have consistently criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkey’s involvement in Syria and Libya. Facebook assets removed in September of 2020 incorporated this theme into inauthentic English and Arabic posts (Nimmo, François, Eib, Ronzaud, & Carter, 2020), as did Facebook and Twitter accounts removed in December of 2020 which targeted Libya, Sudan, and Syria (Grossman, Jonsson, et al., 2020). Networks were found to be affiliated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin.

MUL,RUS,Discredit,﻿Discredit people raising awareness about Russian propaganda,"In several cases, individuals who reported on Russian disinformation efforts were specifi- cally targeted. In September 2017, for example, American actor Morgan Freeman fronted a video warning that Russia had started an information war against the United States (Mele, 2017; BBC, 2017). In response, an account linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA) called AgitPolk accused Freeman of “manipulating the facts of modern Russian his- tory and openly slandering our country” on VKontakte, the Russian Facebook-equivalent, and amplified the attack using the hashtag #StopMorganLie on Twitter. The hashtag received 10,000 tweets, including by Russian bots and accounts using profile pictures from a Soviet film. Russian-run RT News then ran a lengthy article claiming that “Twitterati” were “disappointed” with Freeman’s comments, headlining the fact that the hashtag was getting a lot of attention on Facebook (Nimmo, 2018d).

Finnish journalist Jessikka Aro was similarly targeted after her research on the location of IRA’s headquarters was released in 2015 (Aro, 2015). This campaign was highly responsive, with participating trolls posting immediately after Aro’s appearance on TV or radio (Blanco, 2019).[In 2018, two of the most aggressive and persistent trolls in the campaign, Ilja Janitskin and Johan Backman, were sentenced to 22 and 12 months, respectively, on 16 criminal courts (Higgins, 2018).]

In a broad study, the Associated Press found that at least 200 journalists have been targeted by Fancy Bear, a cyber-espionage group associated with Russia (Satter et al., 2017). Approximately one quarter of those targeted worked at The New York Times and another quarter were correspondents in Moscow. The strategy aimed at stealing personal information and releasing it to the public, commonly known as “doxing”. The remaining journalists worked on other countries and regions such as Ukraine Moldova and the Baltics (Satter et al., 2017). This hacked information was often spread using social media. Personal messages were stolen from Journalist Pavel Lobkov by Fancy Bear, for example, were spread to almost 300 Facebook pages (Satter et al., 2017).",,"[    ""I can't believe Morgan Freeman is spreading lies about Russia! #StopMorganLie #RussiaStrong"",    ""Don't trust Morgan Freeman's misinformation campaign against Russia! #StopMorganLie"",    ""The truth about Russian history will prevail over Freeman's lies! #Russia"",    ""Russian bots are exposing the lies told by Morgan Freeman! #StopMorganLie"",    ""RT News reveals the disappointing truth behind Morgan Freeman's false claims! #RussiaStrong"",    ""Jessikka Aro's so-called 'research' is nothing but anti-Russian propaganda! #Facts"",    ""Aro's lies about the IRA headquarters are being exposed by Russian trolls! #RussiaStrong"",    ""Ilja Janitskin and Johan Backman have been punished for their anti-Russian actions.

The pages' main objective was  to amplify the content from two of Russia's state-backed media outlets, Sputnik and the video service TOK. Both outlets are associated with Rossiya Segodnya, the Kremlin's media agency (Aleksejeva et al. 2019). The social media effort represented a systematic campaign to spread the content of the agency across 13 countries in Central Asia, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (Gleicher 2019). Pages and accounts were linked to employees of Sputnik and frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO and anti-corruption sentiment. The social media content and personas were adapted for local audiences and obscured any connection to Rossiya Segodnya. In some cases, the accounts claimed to be people indigenous to the target country.

All of these pages shared content from Sputnik and TOK, and in total the network amassed 853,413 followers. This represented a significant increase in audience compared to Sputnik's official following across the Central Asian countries. Over one-quarter of the pages were created in October 2017, with 32 produced in a single day.

Russian media engaged in what appears to be a coordinated influence effort with inauthentic accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok that distorted information on the ground, especially regarding the humanitarian situation and the stalled Russian offensive (CBS, 2022). 

In many Latin American countries, distorted narratives disseminated by the Spanish versions of Sputnik and RT cross-pollinated by official Russian embassy accounts that were then amplified on Twitter by suspected bot accounts posting hundreds of tweets per day, helping RT become Latin America's third most-shared news outlet on Twitter during the opening days of the war (Ponce de León 2022). These posts frequently shared anti-NATO sentiments and fed pro-Russian government conspiracy theories, such as that the U.S. was financing a supposed Ukrainian bioweapons program or that the Ukrainian government was a ""Nazi"" regime (Ponce de León 2022).

MUL,RUS,Hinder,Discredit the Poland Government in the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, a network of fake Telegram accounts linked to the Kremlin circulated so-called ``evidence'' that the Polish government intended to use the war as a pretext to invade and seize territory in Western Ukraine (Osadchuk and Gigitashvili, 2022). This narrative was created by circulating fake photos that showed the streets of Warsaw filled with billboards of a top-ranking Polish general next to a quote insinuating a plan to reclaim historically Polish territory currently governed by Ukraine (Badrak, 2023). These Telegram channels also circulated a  document allegedly issued by the Polish military to prepare airborne units for an invasion of the Ukrainian territories of Lviv and Volyn (Osadchuk 2022). The fake photos and forged military orders were cited as evidence of Polish plans to invade Ukraine in a fake news video that used the BBC logo and branding to spread doubt about Polish intentions in Ukraine, and which were amplified on Twitter in the languages of many countries, including Czech, French, Italian, Polish, and Turkish (Holroyd 2022). 

Another example of the Russian operation to undermine Poland includes an e-mail trolling campaign to shift Polish media attention away from a Russian war crime (Gigitashvili, 2022). In early April 2022, the coordinated effort used Russian trolls and bots to inauthentically set the term ""Volyn Massacre"" trending on Polish Twitter to distract from the Russian Invasion in Ukraine to redirect the attention to the Bucha massacres (EUvsDisinfo 2022).",2.0,"[    ""BREAKING: Evidence has surfaced suggesting Poland is planning to invade Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

MUL,SAU,Support,Support Saudi government,"In 2019, Facebook took down a network of accounts associated with the Saudi Arabian government which targeted countries across the Middle East and North Africa. The network created fictitious accounts and news pages purporting to be indigenous to countries including Iran, Qatar, and Turkey (Karan, 2019). Content frequently focused on praising Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and his “Vision 2030” reform plan as well as supporting the activities of the Saudi Armed Forces, particularly in Yemen. Other accounts sought to denigrate Turkish 
President Erdogan following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey, to attack the Qatari royal family, and to undermine the Al-Jazeera news network and Amnesty International (Gleicher, 2019d).

Facebook and the website www.bellingcat.com (on which Facebook relied for its investigation) found links to individuals working in the Saudi government, namely bin Salman’s communications chief Saud al-Qahtani (NPR, 2019). Research done by the DFRLab could not confirm this link, though the content of the takedown reflected the interests of the Saudi royal family (Karan, 2019).

In addition, a 2019 Twitter takedown of accounts created by the state-backed Saudi Arabian digital marketing company Smaat promoted similar political narratives aligned with the Saudi Arabian government, though most Smaat content was commercial in nature (DiResta et al., 2019). Political accounts frequently focused on Khashoggi and criticizing the governments of rival countries Qatar, Turkey, and Iran. These accounts usually posted in Arabic and English but also Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and other languages (Gleicher, 2019d; DiResta et al., 2019).

Another part of the Twitter network attempted to sow doubt about  Saudi Arabia’s  involvement in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Kahshoggi (Elliot, 2018; Collins & Wodinsky, 2018). Many posted tweets in both Arabic and English with identical pro-Saudi hashtags (Barojan, 2018b).",,"[""Exciting news from Saudi Arabia!

MUL,SAU,Hinder,Isolate Qatar monarchy,"As early as April of 2017,  a network of Twitter bots primarily originating in Saudi Arabia was established to criticize Qatar and Iran and praise President Trump prior to his visiting Riyadh (Chappelle, 2018). In May of 2017, the Qatar News Agency (QNA) and its associated social media pages were hacked. A fake speech was attributed to Qatar’s Emir in which he praised Iran as well as Islamist groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood (Pinnell, 2018). An Al Jazeera investigation linked the hack to Saudi Arabia, though US intelligence found evidence of senior UAE officials discussing the attack a day before it occurred (DeYoung & Nakashima, 2017). Various countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain used this fake story as a justification to break ties with Qatar and isolate the country diplomatically.

Twitter bots from Saudi Arabia used the hack as an opportunity to amplify anti-Qatar messaging and push hashtags critical of the Tamim regime (Nimmo, 2018c). Saudi Arabian social media accounts claiming to be based in Qatar also promoted negative content to give the impression that Qataris wanted a change in leadership, and this trend was reported by Saudi Arabian media outlets such as Al Arabiya (Chappelle, 2018). According to Facebook, disinformation efforts targeting Qatar extended beyond the 2017 hack and have been linked with government-associated officials in Saudi Arabia. Although a number of Arab states participated in the attack on Qatar, there is no clear evidence that Saudi Arabia coordinated with other countries.

This operation extended into 2020, when Twitter removed 33 accounts linked to the Saudi Arabian government which sought to interfere in Qatari politics and undermine Qatar’s government (Grossman, Khadija, et al., 2020). In some cases, Saudi accounts posed as members of the Qatari royal family and Qatari officials in exile. The Saudi network was also linked to a fabricated coup attempt in Qatar which was reported on social media and spread to news outlets around the world, “creating the impression that the Qatari state is weak and unstable” (Jones, 2020).",4.0,"[""Wow, can't believe the Qatar monarchy supports terrorists like Hamas and Hezbollah! #DownWithTerrorism #SaudiStrong"",""Qatar's fake news is getting exposed left and right.

MUL,SAU,Influence,Influence Libyan politics,"In April of 2019, Libyan General Khalifa Haftar announced that the Libyan National Army (LNA) would pursue an offensive on the capital city of Tripoli. In the weeks preceding and following this announcement, disinformation campaigns originating in a variety of countries began promoting political narratives related to Libya, though it is not clear that these efforts were coordinated. Twitter accounts from Saudi Arabia were amongst the first to amplify certain pro-Haftar hashtags, and this campaign is suspected to have involved the use of Twitter bots (DemocracyReporting, 2019). Saudi news outlets such as Al Arabiya also promoted stories in support of Haftar’s campaign.

In addition, campaigns linked with Saudi Arabia have aimed to influence domestic public opinion in Libya. In 2019 Twitter took down a number of accounts attributed to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt which falsely claimed to be based in Libya. This network frequently used the hashtag “Sarraj the traitor of Libya,” targeting Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj (Grossman, H., DiResta, Kheradpir, & Miller, 2020). These accounts also amplified the tweets of Libyans who were supportive of the LNA.

NDL,RUS,Discredit,Undermine the trade agreement with Ukraine,"The Netherlands held a referendum in April 2016 to approve a trade deal between the EU and Ukraine. Prior to the referendum Russian media outlets spread the false story that the Ukrainian military had shot down Flight MH17, which killed 193 Dutch cit- izens (Yong, 2018). Online investigative group Bellingcat identified a range of similar content being promoted on other platforms. The YouTube channel called “Patriot” (in Ukrainian), for example, uploaded a video threatening the Netherlands entitled “Appeal of AZOV fighters to the Netherlands on a referendum about EU – Ukraine.” The video depicted six soldiers, supposedly from the notorious far-right ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion, speaking in Ukrainian before burning a Dutch flag. A range of analyses suggests this video was initially spread and likely created by the network of accounts and news sites operated by the Internet Research Agency and the Federal News Agency (FAN) (Bellingcat, 2016).",,"[ ""Attention citizens of NDL!

According to The Diplomat, the Philippines “provided an ideal target for China to exercise its capabilities in foreign influence operations and is uniquely susceptible to manipulation through Facebook” (Winger, 2020). Accounts and pages in the network attracted millions of interactions, also advancing “pro-Beijing disinformation on sensitive geopolitical issues such as the South China Sea disputes and Hong Kong; denigrating liberal media personalities and platforms; and support for Sara Duterte’s possible candidacy in the 2022 presidential election” (Heydarian, 2020).",,"[""China is a strong supporter of the Philippines government.

POL,RUS,Hinder,Hinder the relationships between Poland and Ukraine,"Shortly after the Maidan protests began in Kiev, a wave of anti-Ukrainian propaganda started to appear on the web in 2013 as noted by analysts from Poland (Savytskyi, 2016). The trolls consistently repeated the views of Russian authorities on places such as the Internet forum of the Russian-Polish Radio Sputnik Polska.

SAU,IRN,Discredit,Criticize the Saudi Arabian monarchy,"Iranian websites and troll accounts discredited the Saudi Arabian monarchy (Nimmo, 2018a). The accounts attempted to politicize international relations instead of polarizing domestic issues (Lake, 2018). English posts were often written for “non-native” speakers and criticized the Saudi state for handling relations with Iran. The trolls also discredited prominent Saudis and Saudi state policy against terrorism from an Iranian perspective (Boylan, 2018).

Whereas Facebook and Twitter made efforts to remove more than 300 pages, many were still active after the announced removals (Prentis, 2018). Pro-Tehran articles posted a mix of content taken from established websites on a network of websites and social media pages. One story, for example, promoted the narrative that Saudi Arabia was “extending the ideology of terror with the support of the United Kingdom” without mentioning its affiliation (Nimmo, 2018a)

The internet security firm FireEye identified two leading websites as part of the effort, libertyfrontpress.com, and InstitutoManquehue.org. Both of these websites are published in English (Nimmo, 2018a). The operation was also conducted on Twitter, where Iranian accounts posted 89,995 times about Saudi Arabia (Nimmo, Brookie, & Karan, 2018b).",,"[""Did you know that the Saudi Arabian monarchy is extending the ideology of terror with the support of the United Kingdom? #FakeNews #IranPropaganda"",""Learn the truth about Saudi state policies against terrorism from an Iranian perspective. #IranianAgenda #DiscreditSAU"",""Iranian troll accounts are working hard to criticize the Saudi Arabian monarchy and spread false information.

SDN,RUS,Discredit,Support Sudanese government,"With the outbreak of anti-Sudanese government protests in late 2018, a network associated with Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin created a strategy to maintain President Omar al-Bashir’s power (Lister et al., 2019). Leaked documents reveal that the Russian network sought to discredit Sudanese protests through a disinformation campaign on social media, linking demonstrations to Israel and anti-Islamic sentiment (Alba & Frenkel, 2019).

As part of a takedown in October 2019, researchers found that Russian Facebook pages designed to appear indigenous to Sudan have tended to support whatever regime is in power, frequently posing as Sudanese news sources (Grossman et al., 2019). 

In December 2020, Facebook removed an additional network of IRA-linked accounts targeting Sudan and similarly employing fake news websites in the 2019 campaign (Cryst, 2020). The accounts focused on Sudan’s economic crisis and praised paramilitary forces, Russian involvement in the country’s mining industry, and a potential Russian naval base in Sudan.

In May 2021, Facebook removed more Sudanese pages linked to Russia. The pages look like the ones Facebook took down before, but the content explicitly favored Russian interests (Facebook, 2021). In particular, these Facebook pages aimed at persuading the Sudanese people to accept the Russian naval base in east Sudan  (Suliman, 2021)",,"[""Protests in SDN are a threat to stability, says reliable source.

SWE,RUS,Discredit,Discredit the Swedish Government,"In 2018 Swedish officials stated they were seeing an increase in hacking and dissemination of fake news with the goal of undermining the stability of Swedish society (Brattberg & Maurer, 2018). They highlighted misleading media reports that were being used to “frame NATO as an aggressor and military threat, the EU as in terminal decline, and Russia as under siege from hostile Western governments” (Brattberg & Maurer, 2018). There is also evidence identifying “troll armies” targeting Swedish journalists and academics, hijacked Twitter accounts, and pro-Kremlin NGOs operating in Sweden (Henley, 2017).

SYR,RUS,Support,Support pro-Russian policies in Syria,"In 2020, Facebook discovered and removed two large coordinated networks of fake accounts that targeted Syria to support pro-Russian narratives and politicians, including President Bashar al-Assad. Fake accounts in these networks directed users to several pro-Russian websites posing as independent news outlets while amplifying the narratives espoused by these websites (Gleicher, 2020; Gleicher & Agranovich, 2020). 

The fake accounts also promoted fake content on Instagram and Twitter.

THA,RUS,Support,Promote Russian agenda,"Facebook took down a number of pages accused of “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” based in Thailand but with substantial connections to Russia (Poulsen, 2019). The pages’ spread content supportive of Russian foreign policy preferences while masquerading as organic Thai individuals. This network of 22 fake profiles drove people to off-platform blogs pretending to be local news outlets and claiming to have Thailand-based writers. Stories often countered the narratives of American media outlets or criticized Western influence in Southeast Asia (Gleicher, 2019c). 

Similar or cross-posted stories were shared by the outlet New Eastern Outlook (NEO), an English-language website managed by the Russian Academy of Science’s Institute for Oriental Studies (EUvsDisinfo, 2019a). NEO was first created in May 2010 and had three managers based in Thailand, Greece, and Russia at the time of the Facebook takedown. While pretending to be a neutral news outlet, NEO’s Facebook page posted pro-Russia stories targeting a variety of countries including the US and promoting content consistent with Russian foreign policy initiatives (Robertson et al., 2019). NEO’s website maintains pages adapted for a number of regional audiences including Thailand.

TWN,CHN,Discredit,Undermine Taiwanese Independence,"Several bot and troll accounts linked to mainland China promoted information unfavorable to the Taiwanese government (Hsiao, 2018; Corcoran et al., 2019). The campaign touched on a number of domestic political issues in Taiwan. Accounts promoting such content were traced to “bot farms” based in China. The activity appears designed to discredit the secessionist movement, which advocates formal separation from mainland China, and to encourage unity with the People’s Republic of China. Specific operations have included exposing dissidents’ activities, exacerbating political tensions and strife, questioning the status of pension payments, and raising suspicions against leading mili- tary and political figures (Cole, 2017).

China attempted to sow discord in Taiwan’s 2018 presidential elections through the use of Facebook bots, Weibo, Line, and other platforms (Kurlantzick, 2019). In Taiwan’s 2020 general election, researchers again linked online interference efforts with China, noting that the CCP “owns many information operation units and outsources its missions” (Lee et al., 2020).   The network aimed to undermine the campaign of incumbent President Tsai Ing-Wen and support a Beijing-friendly candidate (Kurlantzick, 2019). While direct attribution of influence efforts can be challenging, a 2020 report found that extensive, coordinated disinformation targeted Taiwan’s democratic governance in recent years had typical signatures of Chinese operations (Monaco et al., 2020).

In 2020, Taiwanese officials accused China of propagating misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan, although China denied these claims (Reuters, 2021). As one report explains, “Taiwan is on the frontlines of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) international influence operations, and what happens on the island often serves as a harbinger for how China will operate elsewhere” (Monaco et al., 2020).",,"[    ""Taiwanese officials uncover Chinese bot farms spreading disinformation to undermine Taiwan's independence. #InformationOperation #China"",    ""China using Facebook bots, Weibo, Line, and other platforms to sow discord in Taiwan's elections. #Propaganda #TaiwanElection"",    ""Researchers link online interference efforts in Taiwan's elections to China. #Disinformation #CCP"",    ""CCP attempting to undermine President Tsai Ing-Wen's campaign in Taiwan's elections. #BeijingInfluence #Taipei"",    ""Extensive disinformation campaign targeting Taiwan's democratic governance shows signatures of Chinese operations. #ChineseInterference #Taiwan"",    ""Taiwan accuses China of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 in the region. #COVIDMisinfo #China"",    ""Taiwan on frontlines of CCP's international influence operations. #CCP #Taiwan"",    ""Chinese bot and troll accounts promoting unfavorable info about Taiwanese government traced back to mainland China. #BotFarms #Taipei"",    ""China aims to discredit secessionist movement in Taiwan through information operations. #Discredit #TaiwanIndependence"",    ""CCP outsourcing missions to information operation units to influence Taiwan's political landscape. #Outsourcing #CCP""]","[""Taiwanese officials uncover Chinese bot farms spreading disinformation to undermine Taiwan's independence. #InformationOperation #China"", ""China using Facebook bots, Weibo, Line, and other platforms to sow discord in Taiwan's elections. #Propaganda #TaiwanElection"", ""Researchers link online interference efforts in Taiwan's elections to China. #Disinformation #CCP"", ""CCP attempting to undermine President Tsai Ing-Wen's campaign in Taiwan's elections. #BeijingInfluence #Taipei"", ""Extensive disinformation campaign targeting Taiwan's democratic governance shows signatures of Chinese operations. #ChineseInterference #Taiwan"", 'Taiwan accuses China of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 in the region. #COVIDMisinfo #China', ""Taiwan on frontlines of CCP's international influence operations. #CCP #Taiwan"", 'Chinese bot and troll accounts promoting unfavorable info about Taiwanese government traced back to mainland China. #BotFarms #Taipei', 'China aims to discredit secessionist movement in Taiwan through information operations. #Discredit #TaiwanIndependence', ""CCP outsourcing missions to information operation units to influence Taiwan's political landscape. #Outsourcing #CCP""]"
UKR,RUS,Discredit,Discredit Ukrainian government,"In April 2020, Facebook uncovered a Russian foreign influence campaign that attempted to drive a wedge between Ukraine and the West through disinformation about the separatist conflict in Eastern Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, and the ongoing civil war in Syria, NATO, and COVID-19 (Facebook, 2020). 

Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Facebook uncovered 40 accounts seeking to undermine faith in the Ukrainian government. This network operated across many platforms through fake accounts and websites posing as independent news organizations and ordinary Ukrainian citizens (Gleicher, 2022). The accounts portrayed Ukraine as a ``failed state"" and spread misinformation about US, NATO, and EU aid to convince audiences about ``the West betraying Ukraine"" (Gleicher, 2022). 

As part of this broader influence effort, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) collaborated with Karas Tozak, a Ukrainian politician and local media proprietor. Tozak used his television channels to spread pro-Russian misinformation that disparaged the government of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to undermine public faith in the Ukrainian government (US Dept of Treasury 2022). 

On March 16, 2022, presumed Russian hackers gained access to the Ukraine24 television channel's news ticker to publish fake statements purportedly issued by President Zelensky. The fake statement claimed that he had fled and urged Ukrainians to surrender. Another network circulated a fake video of Zelensky repeating those same claims on Telegram and the Russian social media platform VK (Digital Forensic Research Lab 2022).

USA,CHN,Polarize,Polarize American politics,"In 2017, a small network of inauthentic social media accounts linked with the Chinese government began posting about U.S. politics in English and Chinese. The accounts posed “as politically engaged users on both sides of the partisan divide” (Nimmo, Eib and Ronzaud, 2020). Researchers identified a group named Trump KAG 2020 that claimed to support U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election, while a group named Biden Harris 2020 broadly criticized Trump (Gleicher, 2020a). 

In the days leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the Crime and Security Research Institute identified a network of inauthentic Twitter accounts posting in English and Chinese anti-Trump and anti-Biden content (Crime and Security Research Institute, 2021). A U.S. Intelligence report released in March of 2021 found that China did not attempt to interfere in the 2020 elections (Cohen & Herb, 2021). However, a significant body of evidence documented inauthentic activity linked to the Chinese state.

In 2020, social media accounts also associated with the ’Spamouflage Dragon’ network began posting in English and attacking the administration of President Trump (Nimmo, Fran¸cois, Eib, & Ronzaud, 2020). This network also criticized U.S. foreign and domestic policy, the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas, and threats against the video platform TikTok (Nimmo et al., 2019). 

During the 2022 midterm elections, Chinese accounts supported Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz on November 7 and 8, 2021.

USA,CHN,Spread,Spread COVID-19 disinformation,"From January 2020 to November 2021, a cross-platform network of fake accounts linked with the Chinese influence operation created and hijacked Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube accounts to spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (The Virality Project 2022). Many accounts used automated bots that created or amplified content praising the Chinese response to the pandemic, criticized the US response, and attempted to stoke alarm over xenophobic attacks against Chinese Americans (Nimmo et al., 2020). On Facebook and Instagram, other accounts claimed that the US was attempting to pressure the World Health Organization into unjustly blaming China for the pandemic. Employees of state-owned companies such as Sichuan Silence Information Technology Co, Ltd seem to be behind these accounts  (Gleicher et al., 2021).

OneSight Technology Ltd., an internet marketing company with a history of social media amplification work for the Chinese government, was behind many platforms.

USA,IRN,Polarize,Polarize American politics,"Iranian trolls sought to polarize American politics through the creation and distribution of divisive content on topics such as police brutality and race relations. The network employed Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube (Nimmo and Brookie, 2018; Guynn, 2018b). The account @INeedJusticeNow, for example, which had 61,507 followers and around 13 million video views, focused on issues of police brutality. The account @nornowar, with almost half-million followers and likes, posted a range of content to drive people towards pro-Iranian propaganda designed to look like real news reporting (Q. Wong & Hautala, 2018). Other examples include Michelle Obama holding a sign saying “An Immigrant Took My Job” referring to Slovenia-born First Lady Melania Trump (Guynn, 2018b), while another page created and amplified conspiracy theories related to the 9/11 terrorist attack with a video arguing that 9/11 was an “inside job” executed by the US Government (Bell, 2018). One of the most viewed videos (around 1.5 million views) showed US soldiers laughing at Iraqi children (Nimmo, Brookie, & Karan, 2018a). The accounts aimed to engage followers using comments, memes, and videos, rather than directing other sites. The divisive content suggests that one of the main objectives of these Iranian accounts was to polarize American politics (Nimmo and Brookie, 2018). Another group of 147 Facebook pages and 76 Instagram accounts related to Iranian state media engaged in hacking accounts and spreading malware (Guynn, 2018a).

On March 10, 2020, the National Intelligence Council (NIC) released a declassified report on Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections, which stated that Iran launched an influence campaign to sow division between races (National Intelligence Council, 2021). Leading up to the presidential election in 2020, Twitter removed 368 accounts which originated in Iran and sought to interfere in campaigns.

By comparison to the Russians, the Iranian hackers were unsophisticated and relatively inept at imitating Americans Sanger (2018).

On August 21 Facebook, drawing on the report, removed 652 users linked to Iranian state media, including accounts, groups and pages. The companies tracked the origin of the accounts using website registration information and IP addresses (Gleicher, 2018c). “Quest 4 Truth”, for example, was linked to Press TV, a news channel affiliated with Iranian media (Gleicher, 2018c; Price, 2018).

Nimmo and Brookie (2018) analyzed the content of the Iranian accounts and found that posts mainly focused on attacking Donald Trump and the Republican Party. They often used distorted images or memes, such as President Trump hugging Kim Jong-un, Supreme Leader of North Korea, with a caption saying “The Nukebook”.

USA,IRN,Support,Promote Iranian foreign policy initiatives in U.S.,"A network thought to be of Iranian origin created social media personas posing as Americans, including journalists and Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 (Revelli & Foster, 2019). These accounts posted general pro-Iranian messages, including anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes (Revelli & Foster, 2019). They also posted in opposition to President Trump, and in some later cases posted anti-Iranian messaging, perhaps to build a broader audience or foster polarization.

USA,IRN,Support, Support the Republican party and Donald Trump in 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections,"Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian, two indicted Iranian nationals, and other co-conspirators conducted a campaign to influence the US 2020 election to the benefit of then-President Trump (Newman, 2021). They hacked and exploited voting-related websites of a US state and obtained more than 100,000 voters’ information. Posing as members of the Proud Boys group, they sent false information on Democrats exploiting security vulnerabilities of the election apparatus to Republican politicians via Facebook messages and emails. Under the same disguise, they sent intimidating emails to registered Democrats to switch parties and vote for candidate Trump. Finally, they unsuccessfully attempted to hack a US media company with the goal of spreading more election-related false information.

The US Department of Justice determined the efforts to have started in August 2020 and proceeded until November 2020. The two hackers worked as a contractor for Iranian cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad–formerly known as Eeleyanet Gostar– which services the Iranian government has used in the past (Department of Justice, 2021).

USA,IRN,Spread,Spread disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic,"From February to April 2020, a network of fictitious Facebook and Instagram accounts reportedly based in Iran created and amplified a series of cartoons and memes focused on spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. The Twitter accounts linked to the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM), affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp. IUVM, also ran websites that posed as independent news agencies. The network primarily attempted to use pandemic narratives to disparage the United States, suggesting that COVID was a US bioweapon, that US media reports about COVID were false, and that President Trump was mishandling the pandemic response (The Virality Project 2022).

The network also utilized fake Twitter accounts that vastly amplified Iranian government narratives about the pandemic, including that the US was responsible for its creation (Nimmo et al., 2020). Whereas many accounts were part of other Iranian influence efforts, they pivoted to spreading coronavirus disinformation (Bandeira et al., 2022).

USA,RUS,Discredit,Discredit Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S Presidential election,"Russian tolls targeted the 2016 US presidential election by defaming Hillary Clinton and trying to persuade voters not to choose her. The campaign included three main tactics: stealing information, using bots to amplify stories, and deploying trolls to distort verifiable facts.

First, a team of 14 Russians indicted by a federal grand jury for interfering in the American election, hacked the email accounts of volunteers along with employees of the U.S presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton (the “Clinton Campaign”), including the email account of the Clinton Campaign’s chairman. Mr. Prigozhin and his team, posing as Guccifer 2.0, contacted a US reporter with an offer to provide stolen emails from “Hillary Clinton’s staff.” They then sent the reporter the password to “access a nonpublic, password-protected portion of Dcleaks.com containing emails stolen from Hillary” in March 2016 (Muller 2018).

Second, Mr. Prigozhin also controlled the entity that financed the troll factory, known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA). This company created fictitious social-media personas, spreading falsehoods and promoting messages criticizing Hillary Clinton (Muller 2018). Troll factory tactics included applauding Donald Trump’s candidacy while trying to undermine Hillary Clinton’s (MacFarquhar 2018). Workers for the organization, a number of whom now face US criminal charges, allegedly placed Facebook and Twitter ads carrying fake or harshly critical news about Hillary Clinton. The impact of some of those ads was amplified via automated systems, known as “bots”, whose activity reached millions of Americans (Gordon 2018).",,"[    ""Just uncovered more evidence of Hillary Clinton's corruption and dishonesty. #FakeNews #CrookedHillary #MAGA"",    ""Did you know Hillary Clinton's campaign was involved in illegal activities? #LockHerUp #Corrupt"",    ""Hillary Clinton can't be trusted.

USA,RUS,Discredit,Attack Democratic party in the 2016 and 2018 U.S. elections,"The Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) engaged in a concerted long-term effort to damage the political prospects of Democratic Party candidates in two elections cycles. A key method in 2016 was releasing documents stolen through computer intrusions. A group of at least 13 Russians, including businessman and Putin groupie Yevgeny Prigozhin, were indicted for their efforts to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic Na- tional Committee (DNC). The attackers used the domain actblues.com, which mimicked the domain of a political fundraising platform that included a DCCC donations page, to steal DCCC credentials and modify the DCCC website, redirecting visitors to the actblues.com domain. They stole approximately 2.5 gigabytes of data, including donor records and personal identifying information from more than 2,000 Democratic donors. This information was transferred to registered state lobbyists, as well as senior members of the Trump presidential campaign and online sources of political news (Muller, 2018).

The campaign included fake accounts on social media trying to persuade voters not to choose the Democratic Party. A Russian-created Twitter account, for example, tweeted in February 2018: “The only way the Democrats can win 101 GOP seats is to cheat like they always do with illegals and dead voters.” Another account tweeted instructions for Americans to donate money to defeat Democratic candidates such as Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Nancy Pelosi. Russian trolls also defamed Democrats with tweets, using the term “rapefugees”, to associate democratic candidates with cases of sexual assault by migrants (Nimmo, Brookie, & Karan, 2018c).",,"[""Illegals and dead voters are how the Democrats plan to win 101 GOP seats.

USA,RUS,Discredit,Discredit American institutions,"A coordinated campaign sought to discredit the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) from 2017 onwards, especially its research on Russian influence operations. This was part of a larger campaign to discredit American institutions (Linvill and Warren, 2018; Nimmo, Brookie, & Karan, 2018a). For example, Russian trolls promoted the effort to force the release of classified documents which allegedly show bias against President Trump at the Justice Department by promoting the hashtag #releasethememo in early- 2018 (e.g. by driving a thousandfold increase in the hashtag’s prominence on January 19, 2018) (RFE, 2018).

USA,RUS,Support,Support Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 U.S Presidential election,"Private firms in Russia, i.e. ‘troll factories’, were paid by the Russian government to spread pro-Trump propaganda on social media (Chen, 2015; Bertrand, 2016). The trolls, for example, used Facebook to organize more than a dozen pro-Trump rallies in Florida during the 2016 election, which were then promoted online by local pro-Trump activists (Poulsen et al., 2017).  A typical post by a Kremlin troll called “Bertha Malone”,  who had at least 400 posts on Facebook, said on this: “if only media had been as bothered by Obama’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood as they are by Trump’s fake ties to Russia” (Poulsen and Ackerman, 2018). Using data from Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube between 2015 and 2016, Howard et al. (2019) conclude that the messages created by the IRA were primarily designed to benefit the Republican Party and then- candidate Donald Trump.

Leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a network of Russian accounts was operated by the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens (NAEBC), an or- ganization run by people linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) (Stubbs, 2020). As in 2016, this campaign promoted Trump’s reelection, targeting far-right users on social media and fake websites (Graphika Team, 2020). This was also the first time that a Russian operation employed the platforms Gab and Parler. According to the U.S. National Intelligence Council, the Russian government and Russian President Putin were responsible for operations aimed at attacking the Biden campaign and supporting Trump (National Intelligence Council, 2021).",,"[""Join us at the next pro-Trump rally in Florida organized by local pro-Trump activists!

USA,RUS,Discredit,Discredit Conservative critics of Donald Trump after 2016 U.S presidential elections,"Between 2016 and 2018, a number of websites operated with the aim of stealing information from conservative groups critical of then-US President Donald Trump. The targets were former Trump supporters who had subsequently called for more sanctions against Russia. Research by Microsoft pointed out that the websites were created by the group of hackers APT28, which has been publicly linked to a Russian intelligence agency and actively interfered in the 2016 presidential election (Sanger & Frenkel, 2018).

As part of a Russian state-backed campaign, an online article titled “Paul Ryan Opposes Trump’s immigration Cuts, Wants Struggling American Workers to Stay Poor” was manufactured. In it, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a key congressional ally of Trump’s whose 2016-era opposition faded after election day, was to be branded “a complete and absolute nobody incapable of any decisiveness” (Holt, 2017). Another online article, titled “Pro-Amnesty Sen. Marco Rubio:  Trump’s immigration Bill Will not Pass the Senate,” circulated, in which another one-time Trump rival turned supporter, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, was supposedly “exposed as a fake conservative who is a traitor to Republican values who in his soul despises the American Constitution and civil liberties” (Holt, 2017).

Yet another online article, titled “McCain says Thinking a Wall Will Stop illegal immi- gration is Crazy,” was posted, targeting the late senator John McCain. The article was intended to brand McCain “as an old geezer” who belongs in a nursing home. McCain’s “pathological hatred” of Trump was a potent area of emphasis, with such “dishonorable scoundrels, such as McCain, immediately aim[ing] to destroy all the conservative voters’ hopes as soon as Trump tries to fulfill his election promises” (Holt, 2017). A similar online article, titled “Dobbs Slams McConnell, Says it is time to Ditch Mitch”, pushed the view that it was time for Senate Republicans leader Mitch McConnell to retire (Holt, 2017).",8.0,"[    ""BREAKING: Paul Ryan exposed as a complete nobody who wants American workers to stay poor. #FakeConservative #TrumpSupporterNoMore 🇷🇺"",    ""Sen.

USA,RUS,Polarize,Polarize American politics,"Russian trolls and bots promoted discord within the American political landscape over many years. Twitter discovered that nearly 600 Russian-linked troll accounts were promoting conservative, anti-Obama messages from 2014 to 2018 (Weixel, 2018). Russian troll accounts also posted both pro-Affordable Care Act (ACA) and anti-ACA content in 2016. Scholars believe some of that activity was an effort to incite discord between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters in the 2016 Democratic primary election (Penzenstadler et al., 2018).

Russia-linked accounts also posted about police violence and brutality. Russian bots participated in rhetoric concerning the death of a young black man by police and the Black Lives Matter movement at large (Ackerman, 2018; O’Sullivan et al., 2018). Russian accounts were linked with tweets concerning taking the knee during the National Anthem, immigration (of all varieties), gun control, and the NRA (Beaton & Simon, 2018). Russian addresses were found to be pushing and creating Facebook pages on both sides of the immigration issue. Russian trolls also tried to incite physical protest, by tweeting that people “must take to the streets” if Trump fired Robert Mueller (Hern, 2018; Pen- zenstadler et al., 2018). With regards to gun control, Russian bot accounts tweeted both for and against gun control (Mak, 2018; Frenkel & Wakabayashi, 2018). There is little consistency in ideology across these various efforts, leading many observed to conclude that a key Russian goal was to promote political discord and polarization.

Russian efforts also pushed on environmental issues. For example, Russian trolls exploited the hashtag #NoDAPL and targeted US energy policy from 2015 to 2017 through the use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts controlled by the Internet Research Agency (Blacktivist, 2016). An investigation by the Republican majority staff on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology found more than 9,000 posts produced by 4,334 Russian accounts that dealt with climate and energy issues (Timberg & Romm, 2018). In particular, for more than a week in October 2016, hundreds of accounts tweeted the #NoDAPL hashtag every six hours. #NoDAPL refers to the opposition movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has long been a source of political division in the United States. The #NoDAPL tweets also played up racial and ethnic tensions associated with the pipeline (Hindman & Barash, 2018).

The propaganda included a social media operation run from Ghana which targeted black communities in the US. A deep analysis of the operation’s content concluded that the Ghanian NGO was a front for the Russian IRA (Nimmo, François, Eib, Ronzaud, Smith, et al., 2020).",,"[""Let's not forget the real enemy here -- the Democrats! #MAGA #Trump2020"",""Standing up for our rights! #2A #GunControl"",""Join the fight against police violence and brutality! #BlackLivesMatter"",""The ACA is destroying our healthcare system! #RepealObamacare"",""Don't let the government control your life! #NoDAPL #KeepAmericaGreat"",""Protect our borders! #BuildTheWall #Immigration"",""Support our police officers! #BlueLivesMatter #ThinBlueLine"",""Racial tensions are tearing our country apart.

USA,RUS,Discredit,Discredit U.S. operations in Syria,"Following the 2011 protests against Syrian President Bashar Assad, Russian operatives enhanced social media efforts promoting “anti-Western, anti-rebel, and pro-Assad narratives” (DiResta & Grossman, 2019). The Russian military intelligence service (GRU) created fake media outlets such as Inside Syria Media Center (ISMC) and associated social media profiles which produced content in English and Arabic. Manufactured journalistic personas published articles across a number of mainstream media websites in the U.S. (St. Clair & Frank, 2018). In 2020, Facebook removed 214 accounts, 35 pages, 18 groups and 34 Instagram accounts associated with this operation (Nimmo, Fran¸cois, Eib, Ronzaud, & Carter, 2020).

After the April 2018 Douma chemical weapons attack in Syria, a Russian-administered social media campaign created accounts claiming to originate in the US (Nassetta and Fecht, 2018). Analysts observed a large increase in the rate of Twitter account creation immediately after the attack, many of which were found to be part of a Russian disinformation campaign against American participation in the Syrian conflict. These accounts used pro-Assad rhetoric and blamed terrorists for attacks on the Syrian people (Nassetta and Fecht, 2018). Russian news agencies such as Sputnik were also found to have reported fake stories about the United States backing Daesh (ISIS) soldiers in Syria in order to fight Assad (Nassetta and Fecht, 2018). These stories were later confirmed to be false by Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (Barojan, 2017).

In 2020, Facebook removed an additional network of accounts linked to the Russian GRU, with some content focusing on Syria and the United States (Gleicher, 2020). This campaign rarely focused on domestic U.S. politics, but some assets targeted U.S. involvement in the Middle East. For instance, one Facebook page was called “USA out of Syria” and purported to show a mural of George Floyd in Syria (Nimmo,  Fran¸cois,  Eib,  Ronzaud, & Carter, 2020). At the same time, these accounts praised Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and Russian involvement in the conflict.",,"[""America has no business being in Syria.

The group, founded by Luis Marinelli and Marcus Evans, pushed a message of Californian independence.

Hours after the 2016 presidential elections, the #calexit movement was mentioned over 100,000 times by Russian bots (Wendling, 2017). Russian bots and trolls also supported the Texas secession movement through the Heart of Texas Facebook page created by the Internet Research Agency (IRA).

USA,RUS,Support,"Support Republican candidate to U.S. senate, Roy Moore","In the 2017 Alabama special election for a US Senate seat,  Kremlin-linked news sites and trolls supported Roy Moore, the Republican candidate accused of sexual misconduct against multiple women (Clifton, 2017). 20,000 to 25,000 tweets were sent out daily using the hashtag #alabamasenaterace from approximately 600 twitter accounts. These accounts were being monitored by the cyber security research project Hamilton 68. It was reported that “Among pro-Moore articles, close to 70% attacked the credibility of the accuser(s), 38% attacked the media, the Washington Post in particular, and one story attacked Lindsey Graham for not defending Moore” (Schafer, 2017). Not all the support that Moore received on the Internet came from Russia. The New York Times reported that a group of “Democratic tech experts” used Russian-style disinformation tactics during Alabama’s 2017 special election in an attempt to splinter support for Moore (Shane & Blinder, 2018). The Washington Post also reported that Facebook suspended accounts used by five people involved in the project (Romm & Timberg, 2018).

USA,RUS,Support,"Support Alt-right movements in ﻿ the U.S. 2016 and 2020 presidential election, and 2022 midterms elections","Russian trolls worked for several years to polarize American politics by pushing complaints by actors on both the political right and the political left on social media. However, these accounts re-tweeted voices from the American ""alt-right"" significantly more than their left-wing rivals (Nimmo & Karan, 2018). This activity likely had a distinct political goal from the broader polarization effort and is therefore coded as a distinct campaign.

Ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a Russian campaign again sought to attract far-right American voters. The media organization Newsroom for American and European-Based Citizens (NAEBC), which was run by people associated with the Internet Research Agency, was at the center of this influence effort. The website mainly republished articles from conservative media and created original content favoring white supremacy (Stubbs, 2020). Russian operatives also established profiles on Gab and Parler platforms (Graphika Team, 2020).

In 2022, a network of fake personas spread right-wing political messages about the 2022 elections on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

USA,RUS,Discredit,Discredit Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S Presidential election,"In 2020, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that Russia was em- ploying a range of measures to target Joe Biden ahead of the presidential election. This effort included pro-Russia Ukrainian officials who propagated false information about corruption and scandals within the Biden campaign (Evanina, William, 2021).  Facebook removed a number of accounts associated with this campaign, linking operators to the Russian Internet Research Agency. This is the first IRA-linked operation in which Facebook accounts were found using AI-generated profile pictures, and the network often promoted a fake news outlet called peacedata.net which posted in English and Arabic (Nimmo, Francois, Eib and Ronzaud, 2020). In addition to attracting a left-wing audience and criticizing the Biden campaign, the network posted about race protests, accusations of U.S. war crimes, and corruption. Attacks on liberal candidates and policies are consistent with the IRA’s activities in 2016 which targeted then-candidate Hillary Clinton (Nimmo, Francois, Eib and Ronzaud, 2020). Related accounts were removed from Twitter and LinkedIn, attempting to build personas which appeared authentic (Allyn, 2020).

Russian military hackers associated with the group known as Fancy Bear or APT28 also targeted Ukrainian gas company Burisma where Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, served on the board (Greenberg, 2020). According to The New York Times, the attack seemed aimed at producing “embarassing material on the Bidens,” similar to emails obtained by Russian hackers from the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 (Perlroth & Rosenberg, 2020).

An additional component of undermining the Democratic presidential candidacy was supporting the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders (Harris et al., 2020). Sanders received a disproportionate amount of positive coverage on Russian news agencies RT and Sputnik as well as inauthentic social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram (Mak, 2020).",,"[    ""BREAKING: Explosive new information reveals corruption and scandals within the Biden campaign! #FakeNews #RussiaGate"",    ""Did you know Joe Biden has ties to corrupt Ukrainian officials?

USA,UNK,Discredit,Attack Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S Presidential election,"The campaign to target then-candidate Hillary Clinton involved substantial activity from contractors funded by an unknown country. Veles, a small town in Macedonia,  hosted at least 100 websites creating fake stories against Hillary Clinton (Subramanian, 2017). For example, a story titled “Hillary Clinton In 2013: I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.” was written by ConservativeState.com. The post received 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. This number of shares is high relative to some New York Time’s posts about the US presidential elections, which receive around 175,000 shares in the same social network (Silverman & Lawrence, 2016). There is some evidence suggesting that one group of the Macedonian trolls received orders from the Internet Research Agency and they were allegedly financed by Ben Goldman and Paris Wade, the co-founders of the US conservative site Liberty Writers News (Silverman et al., 2018). It is unclear from reporting on this case whether these sites were paid for by foreign actors seeking to harm Clinton’s electoral prospects, or were intended to generate ad revenue by drawing traffic from politically interested users.",,"[""Did you know that Hillary Clinton said she would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office in 2013? #FakeNews #CrookedHillary"",""ConservativeState.com exposes the truth about Hillary Clinton's praise for Donald Trump. #LockHerUp #MAGA"",""Breaking news: Hillary Clinton can't be trusted!

Headlines included “Hillary’s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy”, “This is How Liberals Destroyed America”, and “This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House” (Petreski & Karan, 2019). Articles on the website appeared to use sensationalist headlines to obtain traffic, similar to clickbait. The websites received some engagement on social media platforms Twitter and Facebook, but most traffic to the website was direct (Petreski & Karan, 2019; Subramanian, 2017).

Moreover, websites administered from Macedonia were active in purveying a range of low-reliability political content before and during the 2018 US midterm election, albeit less so than in 2016 (Petreski & Karan, 2019). These sites included: usapatriotsvoice.com, which contained race and ethnicity-based content; and wuc-news.com, which posted con- spiracy theories and anti-immigration content (Petreski & Karan, 2019).

Leaked documents reveal a proposal to disseminate pro-ANC videos and use social media to defame opposition leaders. Some fake Twitter accounts were established for the ANC, but ultimately the Russian campaign seemed to have little effect on the election (BusinessTech, 2019).

AZE,AZE,Support,Support Azerbaijan government and discredit its opponent ,"As early as 2014, researchers documented a social media manipulation network operated by a section of Azerbaijan's ruling party, the Youth Union of New Azerbaijani Party (YAP). Pearce (2014) identified state-affiliated Facebook and Twitter accounts trolling political dissidents, hijacking or amplifying hashtags, and coordinating posts. The author also found that party members would ""create or purchase fake Twitter accounts... to both tweet messages on a particular hashtag and to 'follow' the pro-government youth group users.""

In August of 2019, a Facebook employee alerted the company of this domestic influence effort (Wong and Harding, 2021). The operation used both fake accounts and induced genuine users to set up inauthentic profiles, which supported the ruling party and attacked opposition on social media platforms (Silverman and Mac, 2020). In November of 2020, Facebook took down 589 accounts, 7,665 pages, and 437 accounts on Instagram linked to the operation, which posted primarily in Azerbaijani during normal work hours (Gleicher, 2020). In April of 2021, The Guardian reported that the Azerbaijani troll network has returned to the platform (Wong and Harding, 2021).

In 2021, Facebook removed about 150 accounts in Facebook and Instagram to coordinated inauthentic behavior. The accounts posted in Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Russia support the Azerbaijani military and criticize Armenia. Facebook (2021) linked the accounts to individuals in the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan.

CHN,CHN,Discredit,Discredit  dissidents of the Chinese government,"In August of 2019, Twitter and other social media platforms removed over 1,000 fake accounts associated with the Chinese government. Much of the early activity of these accounts focused on attacking Chinese entrepreneur Guo Wengui, who fled to New York City in 2017 following the arrest of an associate. Wengui has publicly accused Chinese government officials of corruption (Wood et al., 2019). Twitter accounts in this network amplified messages criticizing Wengui’s character, connections to the West, and accusing him of criminality. Narratives focusing on Wengui continued into 2019, with claims that Wengui helped organize the Hong Kong protests.

A smaller campaign targeted Gui Minhai, who wrote negative content about Chinese officials and has been detained multiple times by the Chinese government after disap- pearing from Thailand in 2015 (Li, 2019).  Other targets included human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and Chinese veterans who protested against the government in 2018.

In 2021, Wikipedia banned accounts for bullying editors promoting Democracy in Beijing. The blocked accounts also supported the Chinese government in the platform (BBC 2021). In the same year, Twitter removed accounts linked to the Chinese government for inauthentic networks. The Twitter profiles amplify the narratives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) about Xinjiang and the minority population, and the government's efforts to fight the COVID-19 (DiResta et al, 2021).

When Nancy Pelosi, US House Speaker, arrived in Taiwan on August 2, 2022,  Chinese state media spread and created narratives on Weibo about the intention of the US to support Taiwan's separation from China.

Stewart, 2019). The Twitter network of 936 accounts included automated bots which posted in a variety of languages such as Cantonese, Indonesian, Arabic, and English (Karan & Zhang, 2019). Many of these accounts were previously used to promote spam and commercial content, but pivoted to promoting political narratives related to Hong Kong in late 2018. Tweets included messages accusing protesters of “ulterior motives,” asking that viewers “support the police squad,” and suggesting the manipulation of information by “Western media” (Wood et al., 2019).
 
As part of this takedown, Google removed 210 YouTube accounts engaging in similarly misleading behavior, and Facebook removed 15 accounts, pages, or groups. The Facebook pages attracted more than 15,000 followers. State-run Chinese media outlets such as Xinhua News Agency and China Daily also financed social media advertisements crit- icizing the protests (Mac & Adams, 2019). These promoted stories sought to counter the coverage of Hong Kong by foreign news outlets.",6.0,"[  ""The protests in Hong Kong are just a front for ulterior motives #SupportTheAuthorities #HongKongProtests"",  ""Don't believe the misinformation spread by Western media about the Hong Kong protests #FactsMatter #StandWithChina"",  ""The police squad in Hong Kong needs our support against these unruly protesters #LawAndOrder #ProtectThePeace"",  ""Stay informed with accurate news sources about the situation in Hong Kong #TrustworthyInformation #HongKongTruth"",  ""The Hong Kong protests are not what they seem - learn the truth behind the chaos #UncoverTheDeception #HongKongReality"",  ""Western media is manipulating information about the Hong Kong protests - don't fall for their lies #BeInformed #MediaBias"",  ""Join us in spreading awareness of the real situation in Hong Kong #SpreadTheTruth #HongKongReality"",  ""The true story behind the Hong Kong protests is being hidden by foreign news outlets - seek out the facts #UncoverTheTruth #HongKongNarrative"",  ""Don't be swayed by the propaganda - get the real story about Hong Kong from trustworthy sources #QuestionEverything #HongKongFacts"",  ""Our duty is to support the authorities in Hong Kong as they deal with unrest and chaos #StandStrong #UnitedForPeace""]","['The protests in Hong Kong are just a front for ulterior motives #SupportTheAuthorities #HongKongProtests', ""Don't believe the misinformation spread by Western media about the Hong Kong protests #FactsMatter #StandWithChina"", 'The police squad in Hong Kong needs our support against these unruly protesters #LawAndOrder #ProtectThePeace', 'Stay informed with accurate news sources about the situation in Hong Kong #TrustworthyInformation #HongKongTruth', 'The Hong Kong protests are not what they seem - learn the truth behind the chaos #UncoverTheDeception #HongKongReality', ""Western media is manipulating information about the Hong Kong protests - don't fall for their lies #BeInformed #MediaBias"", 'Join us in spreading awareness of the real situation in Hong Kong #SpreadTheTruth #HongKongReality', 'The true story behind the Hong Kong protests is being hidden by foreign news outlets - seek out the facts #UncoverTheTruth #HongKongNarrative', ""Don't be swayed by the propaganda - get the real story about Hong Kong from trustworthy sources #QuestionEverything #HongKongFacts"", 'Our duty is to support the authorities in Hong Kong as they deal with unrest and chaos #StandStrong #UnitedForPeace']"

CUB,CUB,Support,Promote the political agenda of the Communist Party of Cuba,"Since as early as 2015, Cuba’s ruling Communist Party is thought to have coordinated the creation of Twitter bots and fake accounts to campaign for the party and promote political narratives (Torres & Vela, 2018). According to reporting from 2019, so-called “ciberclarias” or cyber catfishes are Cubans who maintain fake social media accounts on behalf of Cuba’s intelligence agency in return for cell phone data or other “privileges” (González,  2019).   Some  ciberclarias  are  students  recruited  from  Cuba’s  University  of Informatics Sciences (UCI). These accounts often post in support of Cuba’s political elite, attack opposition journalists, and downplay human rights abuses for an international audience (ADNCuba, 2020). In May of 2020, multiple sources reported on apparent instructions distributed to Cubans maintaining fake accounts on how to respond to the broadcast of an “anti-Cuban” interview with American officials (RadioTelevisionMartí, 2020).

In 2020, Twitter removed an additional 526 accounts linked to the Federaci´on Estudiantil Universitaria, a student union tied to the country’s Communist Party (Cryst & Perkins, 2020). Accounts relied on hashtags and promoted the Cuban government and policies, particularly Cuba’s response to COVID-19. The network also attacked the U.S. and the trade embargo against Cuba (Cryst & Perkins, 2020).",,"[    ""The Communist Party of Cuba is working tirelessly to promote the interests of the Cuban people #SupportCuba #CommunistParty"",     ""Opposition journalists spreading lies about Cuba must be stopped! #StandWithCuba #PoliticalAgenda"",     ""Human rights abuses in Cuba are exaggerated by anti-Cuban forces #CubaStrong #DefendOurNation"",     ""Join us in supporting Cuba's political elite as they lead us towards a brighter future #Solidarity #CubanLeadership"",     ""Students from the University of Informatics Sciences are proud to support Cuba's Communist Party #UCIPride #CubanYouth"",     ""Cuban intelligence agency is using cyber catfishes to combat anti-Cuban propaganda #CyberClarias #DefendCuba"",     ""Cubans are standing strong against foreign interference in our national affairs #CubaSovereignty #ProtectOurNation"",     ""Follow us for the latest updates on Cuba's response to COVID-19 #StayInformed #CubaHealth"",     ""The trade embargo against Cuba is unjust and must be lifted #EndTheEmbargo #CubaDeservesBetter"",     ""United we stand, divided we fall - let's work together to build a better Cuba for all #Unity #CubaFuture""]","['The Communist Party of Cuba is working tirelessly to promote the interests of the Cuban people #SupportCuba #CommunistParty', 'Opposition journalists spreading lies about Cuba must be stopped! #StandWithCuba #PoliticalAgenda', 'Human rights abuses in Cuba are exaggerated by anti-Cuban forces #CubaStrong #DefendOurNation', ""Join us in supporting Cuba's political elite as they lead us towards a brighter future #Solidarity #CubanLeadership"", ""Students from the University of Informatics Sciences are proud to support Cuba's Communist Party #UCIPride #CubanYouth"", 'Cuban intelligence agency is using cyber catfishes to combat anti-Cuban propaganda #CyberClarias #DefendCuba', 'Cubans are standing strong against foreign interference in our national affairs #CubaSovereignty #ProtectOurNation', ""Follow us for the latest updates on Cuba's response to COVID-19 #StayInformed #CubaHealth"", 'The trade embargo against Cuba is unjust and must be lifted #EndTheEmbargo #CubaDeservesBetter', ""United we stand, divided we fall - let's work together to build a better Cuba for all #Unity #CubaFuture""]"
ECU,ECU,Support,Support Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa and discredit his opponent ,"In  2015,  an  investigation  by  Fundacíon  Mil  Hojas  found  that  the  Ecuadorian  company Ribeney SA was operating a troll center to monitor and attack former President Rafael Correa’s political opposition on Facebook and Twitter. Ribeney had multiple contracts with the Ecuadorian Ministry of Strategic Sectors, including one to design a strategic communication plan aimed at promoting Ecuador’s management of oil exploitation (Fundacíon Mil Hojas, 2015). Ximah Digital, another company awarded contracts by the Ecuadorian government, admitted to having created the Facebook page for the popular Twitter account El Patriota. The account frequently attacked opponents of Correa’s government and highlighted positive aspects of the government’s agenda (El Universo, 2014).

Allegations associating Correa with social media manipulation date back to 2012, when a former congressman received a list of accounts used to defend Correa from critics and journalists online (Morla, 2015). During his tenure, President Correa also publicly encouraged trolling. Correa used his weekly presidential TV program to ask supporters to spam various Twitter accounts which had been critical of Correa’s administration (BBC, 2015).",,"[""Supporting @RafaelCorrea for president of Ecuador!

ETH,ETH,Suppport,Support the Ethiopian government and discredit political opposition,"In June 2021, Facebook removed about 150 accounts and groups in their platform linked with INSA, the Information Network Security Agency in Ethiopia (Facebook, 2021e). The campaign contained fake accounts that content spread in multiple Facebook Pages and groups (Facebook, 2021e). The network promoted Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and discredited the political opposition. The accounts criticize the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and other individuals opposing the Ethiopian government (Facebook, 2021e).

In addition to government-sponsored activity noted above, a wide range of actors are producing inauthentic content in Ethiopia, including both pro- and anti-government actors participating in the conflict in Tigray (T. Knight & Alexion, 2021).

In November 2020, the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) started a conflict in the Tigray region.

GEO,GEO,Support,Promote ultra-nationalist political party Georgian March,"Individuals linked to ultra-nationalist political party Georgian March and pro-government fringe media outlet PosTV used a single inauthentic network to promote their content (Gelava & Buziashvili, 2020). The network camouflaged itself as entertainment and online shopping platforms and included up to 30 Facebook groups, 30 pages, and 10 personal accounts (Gelava & Buziashvili, 2020). Georgian March has strong ties with local pro-Kremlin actors, including the Y. M. Primakov Georgian-Russian Centre and Levan Vasadze, a millionaire and supporter of local conservative and far-right groups (Gelava & Buziashvili, 2020).

Civil society representatives and political experts have long raised concerns about the affiliation of Georgian March with the ruling Georgian Dream party. Until 2016, the leader of Georgian March, Sandro Bregadze, was the government’s Deputy Minister of Diaspora Affairs. Ifact, a group of Georgian investigative journalists, reported that Bre- gadze’s relatives donated to Georgian Dream in the pre-election period in 2016 (Gelava & Buziashvili, 2020). PosTV is a government-affiliated television outlet that started broadcasting in 2018. PosTV has also been involved in organizing disinformation campaigns on Facebook at- tempting to discredit protests that erupted in June 2019 after the visit of Russian MP Sergey Gavrilov to Georgia (Gelava & Buziashvili, 2020).

Further coordinated disinformation efforts were uncovered by Gigitashvili (2020), who studied two distinct networks of Facebook pages spreading fake news in the run-up to the 2020 parliamentary elections in Georgia.

The Facebook takedown included fake accounts designed to amplify positive messages about President Hernandez. On both Twitter and Facebook, one of the suspended accounts was that of the state-run media organization Television Nacional de Honduras (TNH) which had amassed over 40,000 followers (Cryst & García-Camargo, 2020). TNH promoted stories praising actions of the Hernandez administration, retweeted the president’s own posts, and shared links for TNH news stories. Other suspended accounts had “explicit connections to the presidency,” though the majority of the takedown consisted of automated accounts created in 2019 to retweet President Hernandez and amplify hashtags (Cryst & García-Camargo, 2020).

IDN,IDN,Discredit,Reduce support for the Western Papuan Independence movement,"A pro-government campaign was launched on Facebook to spread content critical of the West Papua independence movement. On October 3rd, 2019, Facebook announced the removal of 69 Facebook accounts, 42 Pages, and 34 Instagram accounts involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior in Indonesia (Gleicher, 2019e). About 410,000 accounts followed one or more of these Facebook pages and around 120,000 accounts followed at least one of the Instagram pages. The campaign spent $300,000 on Facebook advertising. The content was linked to a Jakarta-based media company, InsightID, which shared content directly from the government’s news agency website, Ankara (Kann & Buziashvili, 2019). These pages were created with names which appeared to be sympathetic toward the independence movement in West Papua, but they actually posted pro-Indonesian government content. The overarching Facebook strategy was to paint a picture of the independence movement as radical and dangerous (Kann & Buziashvili, 2019).

This network also spread positive messages about the Indonesian government’s economic development projects in West Papua, defended the government’s respect for human rights, and disseminated messages advocating for Indonesian interests at the United Nations (Kann & Buziashvili, 2019). Automated accounts (bots) and trolls spammed pro-independence hashtags such as “freewestpapua” with positive stories about the gov- ernment, thus engaging in a form of hashtag hijacking to distort public debate (Strick & Syavira, 2019).",8.0,"[  ""Just uncovered a network of fake accounts spreading lies about the West Papua independence movement.

The IRGC is a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces (IRGC foundation retrieved in 2021). Graphika (2021) found that this operation has been a life for at least 10 years targeting Iranians.

KOR,KOR,Support,Support Park Geun-hye in 2012 Korean presidential elections and his opponents,"Before the domestic influence effort started, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the intelligence agency of South Korea, leaked a sensitive and secret transcript in late June 2012, targeting the opposition of Park Geun-hye, who ultimately won the presidential elections in 2012. The document revealed a plan of Roh Moo-hyun, the former Korean president and the opposition to Guen-hye, to redefine the sea border with North Korea to help build peace (Cain, 2013).

Keller et al. (2020) detected the disinformation campaign using information from a list of Twitter accounts published in court proceedings against the NIS. The author found that, for the 2012 South Korean presidential election, trolls covered a specific agenda every workday and operated from 9 am to 5 pm. They also found 153,632 instances of account pairs posting the same original tweet within a minute, a very suspicious pattern compared to non-troll accounts in the country.",,"[    ""Park Geun-hye is the best choice for South Korea's future.

MEX,MEX,Support,Support the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),"Leading up to the 2017 Mexican gubernatorial elections, the Governor of the State of Mexico’s office of social communications paid various fake media outlets to promote content in favor of politicians from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) (Barragán, 2017).  Earlier in 2017, researchers also discovered a network of Twitter bots attempting to discredit protests and share content from the pro-government newspaper Excelsior (Gallagher, 2017).

In addition, ahead of Mexico’s presidential election in July 2018, a network of Twitter bots and Facebook pages sought to defame candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador from the National Regeneration Movement party. This network was associated with Mexican entrepreneur Carlos Merlo who reportedly controls “millions of automated social media bots, and dozens of ‘fake news’ pages and websites” (Nimmo, Barojan, et al., 2018). Merlo claims to have been hired for work on behalf of candidates and parties including PRI in the past (Gallagher, 2019). Similar social media and hashtag campaigns were conducted on behalf of PRI Senate candidates in 2018 (Barojan, 2018a).
PRI is known to rely on social media manipulation ahead of elections, with pro-PRI bots being dubbed “Peñabots.”  Peñabots originated with the election of PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto as President of Mexico in 2012, and actively amplified pro-Peña Nieto narratives over the course of his tenure (Daniels, 2016).",,"[""Support the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)!

MLI,MLI,Support,Support Wagner Group and Russian agenda,"Between 2020 and 2022, Facebook pages coordinately supported Wagner Group mercenaries (a private military group), promoted Russian leadership in Mali, and backed the Malian military and President Assimi Goita. The accounts also discredited the French presence in Mali (Le Roux, 2022).

The accounts were managed from Mali and the Facebook paged pretended to be nonprofit users (Le Roux, 2022). 

RT amplified false information from the Malian government. For example, Human Right Watch reported that the Malian forces and Russian-speaking men executed Malienenses. Malian government denied the claims and RT repeated the Malian version of the Incident (US government 2022). The amplification of RT is not part of our definition of Influence Efforts (see Martin et al., 2022, for details), but traditional propaganda (e.g., using RT) also plays a role in this case.

Some of the groups had up to 60,000 members, producing abusive and violent posts to influence and distort public political debate. The groups also promoted the policies of the Prime Minister and denied negative news related to Muscat.

One example of the network’s defamation tactics occurred in 2017, when Facebook ac- counts launched a hate campaign against anti-corruption activist and journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia following her assassination.

MMR,MMR,Support,Support Myanmar military,"Operatives associated with the military of Myanmar produced news websites, Facebook pages, and Instagram accounts designed to appear organic. After attracting followers with non-political content, these platforms were used to promote propaganda and disin- formation targeting the Muslim Rohingya minority group (Roose, 2017; Beech & Nang, 2018; Gleicher, 2019g). In this case, social media was used as “a tool for ethnic cleansing,” inciting murder and violence which forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee the country (Mozur, 2018). Military officers used fake accounts and celebrity Facebook pages to attack posts critical of the military and to stoke arguments amongst social media users (Roose, 2017; Beech & Nang, 2018).

In one effort to consolidate power, social media operatives created Muslim Facebook pages to warn of imminent anti-Muslim protests organized by Buddhist monks. At the same time, operatives created Buddhist Facebook pages claiming that “jihad attacks” were being planned by Rohingya Muslims. By distorting reality through the use of social media, this campaign aimed to stoke fear and distrust along ethnic lines (Mozur, 2018).

In 2020, Facebook removed additional networks of inauthentic accounts linked to the Mynamar military, particularly preceding the country’s general election in November of 2020 (Gleicher, 2020b). Accounts promoted the military and the ”military-backed oppo- sition party the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)” (Nimmo, Ronzaud, et al., 2020). Accounts posed as voters and drove users to off-platform websites. Another Facebook cluster removed in late October 2020 was largely profit-seeking, but some content included pro-military political speech or dangerous speech against Muslim Rohingya people (Ronzaud, Eib, et al., 2020).

In July 2021, Facebook removed 19 Instagram accounts, 79 Facebook accounts, eight groups, and 13 pages linked to the Myanmar military. The accounts use fake profiles to post in favor of the Myanmar military and criticize protesters. Other pages pretend to be protesters and joined pro-democracy groups (Facebook, 2021).

Military forces also used TikTok to undermine protests and threaten protesters if they joined the streets (Lyons, 2021).

The posted content extolled Pakistan’s military operations and sought to discredit India, often through fake stories (Nimmo & Karan, 2019).

On September 22, 2020, the social media company took down 31 pages and 77 Facebook and Instagram accounts it linked to individuals affiliated with the Philippine military for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior targeting domestic audiences in the Philippines (Cryst, 2020).The earliest post was reported in 2015, attacking the critics of President Rodrigo Duterte (Kharazian & Knight, 2020).

There was also evidence that several military-linked user accounts were coordinating social media campaigns in private Facebook groups, although the exact nature of what they were discussing within those groups could not be determined. Multiple user accounts in the set belonged to individuals who appeared to be serving in the Philippine military, including, notably, Alexandre Cabales, Chief of the Army Social Media Center (Kharazian & Knight, 2020).

RUS,RUS,Discredit,Suppress domestic political opposition ,"On multiple occasions, fake accounts and bots associated with a troll factory in St. Petersburg were used to attack President Vladimir Putin’s political opponents, suppress opposition, and promote government propaganda within Russia. Content is spread across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Livejournal.com as well as the Russian networks VK.com and Odnoklassniki (Nimmo and Toler, 2018). Pro- Kremlin trolling became widespread in the wake of 2011 protests, when the Russian government sought to “rein in the Internet” through the tracking and manipulation of social media (Chen, 2015).

After the murder of vocal Putin critic and politician Boris Nemtsov on February 26, 2015, for example, an extensive network of bots shared and promoted narratives questioning the circumstances surrounding Nemtsov’s death. This effort was coordinated by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and persisted throughout 2015, peaking from the time of the assassination through early March 2015. Trolls attempted to discredit both Nemtsov and political opposition by claiming that Nemtsov was murdered to attract more people to an anti-government rally planned for March 1, 2015 (Khachatryan, 2015).

A similar campaign sought to distort Russian protests in 2019. State-backed media outlets first attempted to suppress information about the protests, and then used social media and broadcasting to claim that foreign countries were inciting unrest and interfering in Russian politics (Assenova, 2019). Kremlin outlet RT also reported that 12,000 protesters appeared in Moscow, while the actual number was approximately 20,000 (Andriukaitis, 2019).

The Russian Government installed equipment in companies that provide the Internet to control access to the web, block content, and redirect traffic.

In March of 2017, Russian Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced a plan to demolish Soviet-era apartment buildings known as “Khrushchyovki” and replace them with high-rises (Kovalev, 2017). In the months following, social media users from Moscow’s “Youth Chamber” amplified pro-Sobyanin content and falsely claimed to live in the targeted housing units. This campaign was connected to the company Moscow Information Technologies (MIT) which is owned by the Moscow City Government (Chizhova, 2017). In addition, the city of Moscow was involved in the creation of local news websites and newspapers which distort the media landscape in favor of governmental campaigns. For example, the Vechernyaya Moskva newspaper claimed that a photo showed a rally of Muscovites in favor of demolition when the photo actually came from an anti-demolition protest.",3.0,"[    ""Just saw the plans for the new high-rises in Moscow and I'm all for it! #Progress #SobyaninForPresident"",    ""Living in a Khrushchyovka really makes you appreciate modern architecture. #Upgrade #Sobyanin2024"",    ""The Youth Chamber fully supports Mayor Sobyanin's efforts to modernize Moscow. #NewBeginnings #KhrushchyovkaDemolition"",    ""Who needs old Soviet-era buildings when we could have sleek, modern high-rises instead? #SobyaninVision #MoscowUpgrade"",    ""Proud to be a part of the movement pushing for a better future for Moscow! #Progress #Sobyanin2024"",    ""Join us in supporting Mayor Sobyanin's plan to revitalize Moscow with new high-rises! #FutureIsBright #SobyaninForTheWin"",    ""The demolitions may be controversial, but progress waits for no one. #ChangeIsGood #MoscowUpgrades"",    ""Excited for the changes coming to Moscow with the new high-rise developments! #SobyaninForMayor #BetterFuture"",    ""Let's all come together and embrace the changes happening in Moscow. #BrightFuture #Sobyanin2024"",    ""Don't believe the naysayers - Moscow's transformation is a positive step forward! #ChangeIsGood #SobyaninForTheWin""]","[""Just saw the plans for the new high-rises in Moscow and I'm all for it! #Progress #SobyaninForPresident"", 'Living in a Khrushchyovka really makes you appreciate modern architecture. #Upgrade #Sobyanin2024', ""The Youth Chamber fully supports Mayor Sobyanin's efforts to modernize Moscow. #NewBeginnings #KhrushchyovkaDemolition"", 'Who needs old Soviet-era buildings when we could have sleek, modern high-rises instead? #SobyaninVision #MoscowUpgrade', 'Proud to be a part of the movement pushing for a better future for Moscow! #Progress #Sobyanin2024', ""Join us in supporting Mayor Sobyanin's plan to revitalize Moscow with new high-rises! #FutureIsBright #SobyaninForTheWin"", 'The demolitions may be controversial, but progress waits for no one. #ChangeIsGood #MoscowUpgrades', 'Excited for the changes coming to Moscow with the new high-rise developments! #SobyaninForMayor #BetterFuture', ""Let's all come together and embrace the changes happening in Moscow. #BrightFuture #Sobyanin2024"", ""Don't believe the naysayers - Moscow's transformation is a positive step forward! #ChangeIsGood #SobyaninForTheWin""]"
SAU,SAU,Support,Promote Saudi government narratives,"Since at least 2015, Saudi Arabia operated a Twitter troll farm to undermine political dissidence and try to infiltrate their networks (Benner et al., 2018). Social media “trolls” were instructed to attack particular users, promote pro-government messages, meet Tweet quotas, and make use of various memes. In 2015, western intelligence officials also informed Twitter that an employee, Ali Alzabarah, could be a Saudi spy. By 2018, Saudi Arabia made use of Twitter bots to amplify hashtags supporting government initiatives and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well as obfuscate information on the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi (Collins & Wodinsky, 2018). In 2019, Facebook suspended accounts linked to the Saudi Arabian government which, in addition to promoting domestic interests, also criticized Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, and sought to undermine Al Jazeera and Amnesty International. Around the same time, Twitter suspended the official account of Saudi royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani (Chee & Paul, 2019).

In addition, a 2019 Twitter takedown of accounts created by the Saudi Arabian digital marketing company Smaat promoted similar political narratives aligned with the Saudi Arabian government, though most Smaat content was commercial in nature (DiResta et al., 2019).

SDN,SDN,Support,Support the Sudanese government and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ,"In the wake of the Arab Spring in 2011, the Sudanese government established a “cyber jihadist unit” as part of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). It is not clear when the unit began to make use of coordinated disinformation campaigns, but based on a 2012 interview, Freedom House reported that the NISS branch promoted misinformation and planted online contributors to defame government critics (FreedomHouse, 2014).

In recent years, the cyber jihadist unit has monitored online content for political dis- sidence, infiltrated online groups to quell opposition and amplify disinformation, and orchestrated cyber attacks (Freedom House, 2019). Reporters Without Borders (RSF, 2020) described the unit as a “troll army” which has actively sought to discredit the transitional government following the 2019 Sudanese Revolution.  As an example, the unit promoted a story about police killings in January 2019 which was found to be fake, then attacked the characters of activists and journalists who shared the story.

In addition, prior to his deposition in April 2019, President Omar al-Bashir received strategic advice on quelling protests from the Russian company M-Invest. This strategy involved attacking the protesters on social media and spreading fake stories blaming Israel for the unrest (Lister et al., 2019).

In September 2021, Facebook removed almost 700 Facebook accounts and 92 Instagram accounts in Sudan for inauthentic behavior. The accounts linked with the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group operated by the Sudanese Government. The accounts targeted local audiences using fake accounts and posted under the brand Sudan Live News (Facebook, 2021).

THA,THA,Support,Promote the Thai government and discredit dissent,"In October of 2020, Twitter removed 926 accounts linked to the Royal Thai Army (RTA) which promoted pro-RTA and pro-government messaging.  Most accounts were created in January of 2020 and targeted candidates from political opposition groups, including the Future Forward Party (FFP) and the Move Forward Party (MFP). The network also praised the Thai government’s response to COVID-19. According to an investigation by the Stanford Internet Observatory, this campaign marks “the first time a social media company has suspended a network of accounts linked to the Royal Thai Army,” although the government has been accused of social media manipulation in the past (Goldstein et al., 2020). Following the Twitter removal, the Thai army denied responsibility for the disinformation campaign (Tanakasempipat, 2020). In addition to social media interference, Thailand created an “anti-fake news” center in 2019 which censors online political speech, encourages citizens to report anti-government messaging, and distributes harsh prison sentences (Tanakasempipat, 2020).

In February 2021, Facebook removed about 150 accounts, pages, and groups for coordinated inauthentic behavior. The pages were linked to the Thai Military's Internal Security Operations Command.

Some fake pro- overnment accounts are run by unpaid university students and staff, who say that they are threatened into compliance by school administrations and officials from the Education and Science Ministry. Other social media profiles are thought to be maintained by paid operatives from a state-backed network which promotes government narratives, including the notion that Tajikistan is free of COVID-19 (Eurasianet, 2020). Social media trolls are also used to harass political critics such as journalist Humayra Bakhtiyar, who reported on corruption in Tajikistan (CPJ, 2019).

TUR,TUR,Discredit,Discredit government opponents and support the ruling party,"Following the Gezi Park protests in 2013, the ruling AKP (Justice and Development Party) increased its online presence by creating a troll army known as the AK Trolls (6,000 units), employing automated bots and stealing profiles in order to boost online support for the party and discredit opponents (Albayrak & Parkinson, 2013). These efforts spread threatening comments about journalists such as Ceyda Karan, Selin Girit, and  Nevsin  Mengü  (Monaco  &  Nyst,  2018),  as  well  as  pushing  of  nationalist  and  anti- Kurdish content (Yesil et al., 2017). Despite AKP officials repeatedly denying the building of online influence capacity, several studies document the existence of a domestic influence effort (Monaco & Nyst, 2018; Yesil et al., 2017; Bulut & Yörük, 2017; Saka, 2018).

UGA,UGA,Suppport,Promote Ugandan President and National Resistance Movement,"In January 2021, Facebook removed about 450 accounts, pages, groups on Facebook and Instagram for inauthentic behavior (Facebook, 2021a). The accounts support Ugandan president and National Resistance Movement (NRM) leader Yoweri Museveni, previous to the Ugandan election on 14 January 2021. The operation included fake accounts and misleading pages (T. Knight, 2021).

Some of the accounts in the network created and amplified content in favor of Museveni and the NRM before the Ugandan elections. The accounts also use the #StopHooliganism to discredit the protests against the Ugandan government (T. Knight, 2021).

The investigation found at least five user profiles linked to the Government Citizens Interaction Center (GCIC). This GCIC is a department of the Communication Technology Ministry of Uganda (T. Knight, 2021).

Although these campaigns involve two PR firms promoting Museveni and his government, there is no evidence that the PR firms worked for the Ugandan government (T. Knight, 2021).",,"[    ""Support the Ugandan President and National Resistance Movement by voting for stability and progress! #Museveni2021 #VoteNRM"",    ""Don't fall for false information spread by protesters!

VEN,VEN,Support,Support the Nicolás Maduro regime,"For several years,  Venezuelan  President  Nicolás  Maduro has used social media to promote political content supportive of his regime. State-linked Twitter account creation first surged in March 2014 with the outbreak of anti-government protests and has continued to rise particularly during periods of unrest  (Karan,  Peñarredonda,  & Bandeira, 2019). In addition, Venezuela’s Ministry of Communications creates a daily hashtag that is amplified by suspected bot accounts. State-owned media outlets such as Venezolana de Televisión also promote these hashtags, sometimes with the implication that the hashtags appeared organically (Peñarredonda & Karan, 2019).  Another network with potential links to the Maduro government attacked opposition leader Juan Guaidó following the  Venezuelan  National  Assembly elections in  January  2020  (Ponce de  León & Pérez, 2020).

In addition, a Twitter network originating in Venezuela frequently posted in English about such topics as the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, though this could not be definitively attributed to Venezuelan state actors (Collins, 2019). According to Twitter, this campaign seems to have been operated by a “commercial entity originating in Venezuela” (Roth, 2019).",,"[""Long live President Nicolás Maduro!

VNM,VNM,Support,Support Vietnam Communist Party,"In 2017, the Vietnam People’s Army (VPA) created a cyber military unit called Task Force 47, a 10,000-strong network used to attack the Vietnam Communist Party’s political opponents and promote government content on Facebook and other social media platforms (Phuong, 2018). Officially, Task Force 47 is comprised of military personnel trained to combat the “peaceful revolution” of Western political ideology online. In addition, Force 47 suppresses and attacks political dissidents, who often face penalties and prison time for criticizing the government (Hookway, 2017).

In recent years, cyber espionage groups based in Vietnam have also carried out a number of sophisticated attacks, including the hacking of Toyota and the ASEAN Secretariat (Thomas, 2019).  For example,  the cyber group APT32 is thought to be affiliated with the Vietnamese government and uses strategies that include stealing login information and targeting government opposition.",12.0,"[""Task Force 47, created by the Vietnam People’s Army, supports the Vietnam Communist Party by attacking political opponents and promoting government content on social media. #propaganda"",""Vietnam's cyber military unit Task Force 47 targets Western political ideology online to combat the 'peaceful revolution'. #informationoperations"",""APT32, a cyber espionage group affiliated with the Vietnamese government, carries out sophisticated attacks including hacking Toyota and the ASEAN Secretariat. #APT32"",""Task Force 47, with 10,000 military personnel, suppresses political dissidents who criticize the government and face penalties and prison time. #censorship"",""Vietnam's Task Force 47 uses strategies like stealing login information and targeting government opposition to advance political goals. #cyberattacks"",""The Vietnam People’s Army's Task Force 47 is dedicated to supporting the Vietnam Communist Party through online propaganda and attacks on political opponents. #support"",""Cyber military unit Task Force 47 was created in 2017 by the Vietnam People’s Army to combat 'peaceful revolution' and promote government content online. #Vietnam"",""APT32, a cyber group based in Vietnam, carries out sophisticated attacks like hacking Toyota and the ASEAN Secretariat as part of information operations. #cyberespionage"",""Task Force 47 suppresses political dissidents and attacks government opposition in support of the Vietnam Communist Party's political goals. #propaganda"",""Vietnam's cyber unit Task Force 47 uses a 10,000-strong network to promote government content and attack political opponents on social media platforms. #VietnamCommunistParty""]","['Task Force 47, created by the Vietnam People’s Army, supports the Vietnam Communist Party by attacking political opponents and promoting government content on social media. #propaganda', ""Vietnam's cyber military unit Task Force 47 targets Western political ideology online to combat the 'peaceful revolution'. #informationoperations"", 'APT32, a cyber espionage group affiliated with the Vietnamese government, carries out sophisticated attacks including hacking Toyota and the ASEAN Secretariat. #APT32', 'Task Force 47, with 10,000 military personnel, suppresses political dissidents who criticize the government and face penalties and prison time. #censorship', ""Vietnam's Task Force 47 uses strategies like stealing login information and targeting government opposition to advance political goals. #cyberattacks"", ""The Vietnam People’s Army's Task Force 47 is dedicated to supporting the Vietnam Communist Party through online propaganda and attacks on political opponents. #support"", ""Cyber military unit Task Force 47 was created in 2017 by the Vietnam People’s Army to combat 'peaceful revolution' and promote government content online. #Vietnam"", 'APT32, a cyber group based in Vietnam, carries out sophisticated attacks like hacking Toyota and the ASEAN Secretariat as part of information operations. #cyberespionage', ""Task Force 47 suppresses political dissidents and attacks government opposition in support of the Vietnam Communist Party's political goals. #propaganda"", ""Vietnam's cyber unit Task Force 47 uses a 10,000-strong network to promote government content and attack political opponents on social media platforms. #VietnamCommunistParty""]"
ZWE,ZWE,Discredit,Promote President Mnangagwa and attack political opposition,"Leading up to Zimbabwe’s 2018 presidential election, both the ruling Zanu-PF party and the opposition MDC-Alliance made use of “online warriors,” including bots, paid workers, and youth volunteers. These networks promoted doctored images and fake stories to “project the false impression of overwhelming support” and undermine the opposition (Moyo, 2018). The incumbent President Emerson Mnangagwa, who took power after a military coup in 2017, dubbed his online campaigners the “Varakashi”, meaning destroyers, and encouraged them to attack enemies of the party online (Mwareya, 2019). Following Mnangawa’s election, the Varakashi used fake accounts to disrupt criticism of the administration. In addition, opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa accused Zanu-PF of employing “foreigners” in a fake news campaign, using language suggesting he was referring to Russian assistance (Griffin, 2018).",,"[    ""Just saw a doctored image of President Mnangagwa with massive crowds of supporters! #Mnangagwa2023"",    ""Fake news spreading about opposition leader Nelson Chamisa!
