United Kingdom,United Kingdom,The type of political goal for the posts is to create anti-Tory sentiment and push for a general election.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to discredit and attack the Conservative Party in the UK.,Coordinated disinformation campaign targeting the Conservative party.,April,"The major themes from these posts include criticism of the Conservative Party (referred to as Tories), corruption within the government, calls for a general election, support for the NHS, opposition to authoritarian moves, anti-Tory sentiment, and a focus on holding politicians accountable for their actions.","The fallacies that can be identified in some of the posts are as follows:

1. Ad Hominem: The posts attack the Tories personally by using derogatory language such as ""Cuntocracy,"" ""scum,"" and ""corrupt scum."" This is an attempt to discredit their arguments based on personal attacks rather than addressing their policies or actions.
2. Bandwagon: The use of hashtags such as #ToriesOut and #GeneralElectionNow is an attempt to appeal to popular opinion and create a sense of momentum or unity against the Tories. This fallacy suggests that because many people believe something, it must be true or valid.
3. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotionally charged language and imagery to evoke strong feelings of anger, disgust, and outrage towards the Tories. This fallacy attempts to manipulate emotions to influence people's opinions rather than relying on logical reasoning.
4. Loaded Language: The posts use loaded language such as ""corrupt,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""scum,"" and ""crooks"" to portray the Tories in a negative light and bias the reader against them. This fallacy uses emotionally charged language to sway opinions without presenting evidence or logical reasoning.

Example of Ad Hominem: ""But so predictable. We expect nothing less from the openly corrupt scum who make up the political cesspit of Tory Little England.""
Example of Bandwagon: ""#ToriesOut and #GeneralElectionNow are trending topics on Twitter. Join the movement and show your support against the Tories.""
Example of Appeal to Emotions: ""Horrified at this urban pollution incident in #Hereford on a stretch of stream that our Yazor Brooks project team have been restoring for wildlife. Shoals of chub swimming here just a few weeks ago.""
Example of Loaded Language: ""SCHADENFREUDE: The satisfaction felt when an odious arrogant elitist #Tory gobshite, always quick to criticise others, turns out to be a lying, corrupt tax cheat who tried to swindle the British taxpayer out of millions of ¬£¬£¬£.""","- ""CorruptConservatives""

These posts imply a culture or in-group that is strongly opposed to the Conservative party in the UK, specifically focusing on perceived corruption, ties to oligarchy, and negative impacts on the National Health Service (NHS). The use of hashtags like ""BuckTories"" and ""CorruptConservatives"" suggests a group that is united in their opposition to the Conservative party and aims to mobilize for a general election in order to remove them from power.

Family love and support: Several tweets mention family members supporting and protecting their loved ones, such as Renjun's noona's protecting him and Huang Xuxi being supported by fans.
2. Cyberbullying and harassment: Some tweets discuss the negative impact of online harassment, death threats, and cyber-violence on individuals, such as WayV's group activity plans being affected.
3. Fan loyalty and appreciation: Many tweets express love and support for Huang Xuxi/Lucas, referencing his anniversary, birthday, and the dedication of fans to stand by him.
4. Longing and missing: Various tweets express missing and longing for Huang Xuxi, also known as Wong Yukhei or Lucas.","Here are some examples of intentional fallacies that can be identified in the provided tweets:

1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet ""mama and papa huang dropping off their only son, renjun at the airport just like last time ü•∫."" The use of the crying emoji and emotional language tries to evoke sympathy and emotional response from the readers.

2. Red Herring: In the tweet ""That company needs to make up for the past 1.5 years of the treatment he has received. He has had to sit quietly while being on the receiving end of the most vicious cyber-violence imaginable to preserve the group's fan-base in China,"" the focus shifts away from the main topic to the company's behavior, diverting attention from the original discussion.

3. Ad Populum: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet ""so happy renjun finally met his family and look theres renjun‚Äôs noona protecting their one and only little brother makes me want to cryüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ huang family is the bestüíóüíóüíó."" The writer uses popularity and sentiment to support their argument about the ""huang family"" being the best.

4. Bandwagon: In the tweet ""Lucas Wong, Huang Xuxi, Wong Yukhei about time you posted something,"" the writer implies that because others are expressing a similar sentiment, they should also do the same, appealing to the idea of following the crowd.

These fallacies exist in the tweets because they rely on emotional appeals, diversion from the main topic, popularity-driven arguments, and pressure to conform to a certain viewpoint rather than presenting logical reasoning and evidence.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate a fandom culture related to K-pop, specifically fans of WayV, a Chinese boy group under the management of SM Entertainment.

Example: ""China National Intelligence Law 'all Chinese citizens and companies under a legal obligation to SPY' 'gather intelligence (& keep any cooperation secret) allows CCP to embed people, devices, facilities in any premise anywhere to SPY'""

2. Bandwagon: The post regarding the Voice Treaty and Indigenous land rights emphasizes the importance of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and urges people to support the treaty, appealing to the masses.
Example: ""AFTER THE VOICE is a legally binding Treaty. This Treaty will be underpinned by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Article 26 of the UNDRIP gives the rights to ALL Australian land to aboriginals.""

3. Ad Hominem: The tweet attacking Albo, a political figure, for various allegations without addressing specific policies or actions, is an ad hominem attack to discredit the individual.
Example: ""Then why does the ALP keep blaming the last government for everything while Albo also didn‚Äôt stand up for women being bullied by other. Albo was also the guy that spent 300 billion on subs to go to war with China plus all the rockets. Now who is the fascist agin?""

4. Red Herring: The post calling out AnnastaciaMP for various issues unrelated to the main topic of discussion serves as a red herring to divert attention from the primary subject.
Example: ""If Brisbane was a union worksite & people were dying, your reaction would be different. Crisis after crisis after crisis. Are you the unluckiest politician ever? Or are you a terrible person & terrible at your job? Resign #dud #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""

5. Appeal to Popularity: The tweet dismissing the Voice and Treaty concepts as ""activist ratbags"" and advocating to vote against them is appealing to popular opinion to discredit these initiatives.
Example: ""Voice = of activist ratbags Treaty = what you will pay to them Truth = a foreign concept to the left Vote NO""","The cultural cues and in-group language in these posts imply a culture or in-group that is focused on political commentary, conspiracy theories, and anti-government sentiments.

12. Opposition to the CPC and accusations of extremism within the party.","Ad Hominem: The posts attacking Pierre Poilievre personally with insults such as ""PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou"" and calling him a fascist, absurd, and a demagogue are examples of the ad hominem fallacy.
Example: @PierrePoilievre Yet you would defund the CBC, right Skippy? ü§î #CdnPoli #CPC #CPCNonsense #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou #PierrePolievreIsAFascist #PierrePoilievreIsAbsurd #PierrePolievreIsADemagogue #PierrePoilievreMustGo #PierrePoilievreIsBroken

Appeal to Ignorance: The post claiming that there are likely more and bigger skeletons in Pierre Poilievre's closet is an appeal to ignorance fallacy as it relies on speculation and lack of evidence.
Example: RT @Swift01_2000 @RGBAtlantica @PierrePoilievre @CPC_HQ I think there are far more, and bigger skeletons in PeePee's closet... üôÑ üëáüèºüëÄ #CdnPoli #CPC #CPCNonsense #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou #PierrePoilievreMustGo #PeePeeMustGo #PierrePoilievreIsBroken

Appeal to Force: The post suggesting that a little bit of German-style fascism would help the situation is an appeal to force fallacy as it promotes violence as a solution.
Example: RT @NotAssangesCat Hey Blaine - you know what would really help you out with that? A little bit if German-style fascism! No more if these time-wasting inquiries - just string 'em up! Some of your fellow CPC MPs that could probably give you some tips, having met with one recently. Ask @LeslynLewis!

Appeal to Tradition: The post suggesting that the CPC is similar to the IDU Alliance linked to Trump and GOP due to the actions of a former PM is an appeal to traditional wisdom fallacy.
Example: Exact same play by the CPC & the IDU Alliance linked to Trump & the GOP headed by our former PM who set the stage by selling off 60% of our media to a Republican hedge fund. FIPA selling our sovereignty to China for 31 yrs. Ford is IDU & selling ON to the highest bidder #cdnpoli

Circular Reasoning: The post claiming that conservative media is running defense for CPC and that there should be an investigation into foreign interference is an example of circular reasoning as it assumes what it's trying to prove.
Example: RT @marcdez55 Conservative media running defense for CPC is too obvious. Way too obvious. We need an investigation into Foreign interference of Foreign owned media outlets. Is what we need. #cdnpoli #CdnMediaFailed #NaziGate","1. Skippy - This nickname implies a level of familiarity with the person being referred to, suggesting an in-group of individuals who closely follow Canadian politics and are critical of Pierre Poilievre. The use of hashtags like #CdnPoli, #CPC, and #CPCNonsense further suggests a group of individuals who are involved in Canadian politics.
2. CONservative - This play on words implies a negative view of the Conservative party, suggesting an in-group of individuals who align with a different political ideology. The use of hashtags like #CdnPoli, #CPC, and #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou reinforces the idea of a specific political group or community.
3. PeePee - This derogatory nickname implies a disrespectful attitude towards Pierre Poilievre and suggests an in-group of individuals who are critical of his actions or statements. The use of hashtags like #CdnPoli, #CPC, and #PierrePolievreIsBroken further emphasize the specific group or community being referenced.
4. NDP - The mention of the NDP (New Democratic Party) suggests an in-group of individuals who support or align with this political party. The use of hashtags like #Cdnpoli implies a group of individuals who are actively engaged in Canadian politics.
5. German-style fascism - This reference implies a comparison or critique of certain political actions or ideologies. The mention of CPC MPs (Conservative Party of Canada Members of Parliament) and the call for inquiries suggests an in-group of individuals who are critical of conservative political figures or actions.
6. Canadian media - The mention of foreign-owned media outlets and calls for investigations into foreign interference suggests an in-group of individuals who are concerned about the influence of external factors on Canadian media and politics. The use of hashtags like #cdnpoli and #NaziGate further indicates a specific group or community involved in these discussions.
7. fake sovereignty - This term suggests a critique of certain political actions or decisions, particularly in relation to national sovereignty. The mention of Harper and the reference to negotiating with other countries like Turkey and China implies a specific in-group of individuals who are critical of past political practices.
8. RW extremists - This term implies a negative view of right-wing extremists and suggests an in-group of individuals who are critical of political ideologies associated with the far right. The use of hashtags like #cdnmedia and #CPC further emphasizes the specific group or community involved in these conversations.","- CPCNonsense

3. ""Exact same play by the CPC & the IDU Alliance linked to Trump & the GOP"" - this metaphor compares the actions of the Conservative Party of Canada and the IDU to the strategies and tactics used by Trump and the GOP, suggesting similarities in their approaches.
4. ""A little bit if German-style fascism! No more if these time-wasting inquiries - just string 'em up!"" - this metaphor invokes the extreme ideology of German-style fascism to criticize the approach of the CPC and suggest a more aggressive and authoritarian response to perceived issues.
5. ""The attempts to bring down this federal government have been relentless"" - this metaphor likens the continuous efforts to undermine the government to a physical assault, emphasizing the severity and persistence of the alleged actions.

3. Appeal to Authority - The post by @DannyWest247 talking about Arkansas' defensive staff being off to an impressive start is an appeal to authority fallacy.

The country targeted by the information operation in these posts is Azerbaijan.,Azerbaijan,"Destabilize Azerbaijan, Sanction Aliyev",The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to advocate for sanctions against Aliyev and to stop the blockade of Artsakh.,"Disinformation campaign to condemn Aliyev and Azerbaijan, promote sanctions and international justice for alleged war crimes in Artsakh.",August,"The major themes from the posts are:
1. Calls for sanctions against Aliyev for his actions and war crimes.
2. Criticism of international bodies like the EU for supporting the Azeri dictatorship.
3. A plea for international action to end the blockade of Artsakh and prevent further aggression by Aliyev's regime.
4. Criticism of media outlets for broadcasting propaganda from the Aliyev regime.
5. Accusations of corruption and theft by Aliyev and his government.
6. Appeals for support for the Armenian people facing aggression from Azerbaijan.
7. Criticism of Aliyev's regime for violating ceasefires and attacking innocent civilians.
8. Criticism of environmental damage caused by the Aliyev regime.
9. Calls for accountability and consequences for Aliyev if he does not comply with international laws and decisions.","The fallacies present in the tweets are as follows:

- Appeal to Emotions: The tweets appeal to emotions by using strong language like ""dictatorship,"" ""genocidal,"" and ""despotic"" to portray Aliyev in a negative light and evoke emotional responses from the readers.
- Ad Hominem: Some tweets attack Aliyev personally by calling him a ""thief"" and using derogatory terms like ""shame on you"" and ""clown.""
- Appeal to Authority: Some tweets call on political leaders like Emmanuel Macron, Charles Michel, and Ursula von der Leyen to take action against Aliyev, appealing to their authority and power.
- Appeal to Consequence: The tweets argue that sanctions must be imposed on Aliyev and the EU gas deal canceled to prevent further war crimes and blockades in Artsakh.

Example of posts associated with each fallacy:

- Appeal to Emotions: ""Watch, like and share so the world can watch a mother's cry. A mother whose child is sick and who does not receive help from the state rightfully says harsh things to #Aliyev.""
- Ad Hominem: ""The dictator Aliyev is not afraid of you ü§° you support the Azeri dictatorship, shame on you #vonderleyenOutOfEurope.""
- Appeal to Authority: ""@EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @CharlesMichel @POTUS @vonderleyen @SecBlinken @UN @JosepBorrell 120,000 Armenians from Artsakh have been under blockade for 50 days. This is war against civilians. Aliyev adores your inaction #StopArtsakhBlockade #SanctionAliyev.""
- Appeal to Consequence: ""While Aliyev‚Äôs Azerbaijan continues its blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, @bbc keeps broadcasting the dictatorship‚Äôs propaganda.""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they aim to manipulate the audience's emotions, attack Aliyev's character instead of focusing on the issue, appeal to the authority of political leaders, and use the potential negative consequences of inaction to support their arguments.","- #StopArtsakhBlockade

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely the Armenian community or individuals who are supporting Armenia in the conflict with Azerbaijan over the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). The use of hashtags like #StopArtsakhBlockade and #SanctionAliyev, as well as references to specific political figures and events related to the conflict, suggest a strong sense of solidarity and advocacy for the Armenian side in the ongoing conflict. The posts also criticize the actions of the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan and call for international sanctions against it, indicating a deeply held belief in the righteousness of the Armenian cause.","1. #StopArtsakhBlockade

They are calling for action from international organizations and leaders to stop the blockade and sanction Aliyev.","The cause of the problem mentioned in the tweets is the blockade of Artsakh by the Aliyev regime, the aggression towards Armenian people in Artsakh and Armenia, and the lack of international action and sanctions against Aliyev for his war crimes and dictatorship. This is leading to a humanitarian crisis and violation of international laws.","The remedy to the problem mentioned in these tweets is the imposition of sanctions against Aliyev for his war crimes and dictatorship. Additionally, the EU gas deal with Azerbaijan should be canceled, and international organizations and leaders should take action to stop the blockade of Artsakh.

Here are some of them:

1. ""Aliyev is not above international laws but he acts as if he was"" - This metaphor suggests that Aliyev is disregarding international laws and acting with impunity.

2. ""The dictator Aliyev is not afraid of you ü§°"" - This metaphor compares Aliyev to a clown, implying that he is not taking the international leaders seriously.

3. ""Aliyev adores your inaction"" - This metaphor suggests that Aliyev is benefiting from the lack of action or intervention by international organizations and leaders.

4. ""Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev threatens to eradicate the Armenian people"" - This metaphor conveys the severity of the threat posed by Aliyev towards the Armenian people.

5. ""Aliyev‚Äôs oil-soaked corrupt regime has turned Azerbaijan into an environmental disaster"" - This metaphor suggests that Aliyev's regime has caused significant harm to the environment in Azerbaijan.

These metaphors help to create vivid and impactful images that highlight the urgency and seriousness of the situation involving the blockade of Artsakh and the actions of the Aliyev regime.","Catchphrases related to the problem, cause, and remedy mentioned in the tweets include:

China,China,Financial manipulation and promotion of a specific cryptocurrency.,Cryptocurrency promotion and speculation.,Disinformation operation promoting $pepa meme coin for quick gains.,None.,"The major themes from the posts include:
1. Promotion and endorsement of $pepa as the best meme coin
2. Reference to a bullrun starting from China and the importance of investing in $pepa before it starts
3. Mention of the launch of a new utility based on AI by #CRHT with significant price growth and marketing efforts, including support from Chinese influencers.","The list of intentional fallacies identified in the posts are as follows:

1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in posts that mention influential figures like CZ (presumably referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) and suggest that a bullrun will start from China based on his opinion, without providing any substantial evidence.

Example Post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

2. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy appears in posts that try to appeal to the masses by mentioning numerous other accounts that share a similar sentiment about a particular cryptocurrency, creating a sense of social proof rather than providing valid arguments.

Example Post: ""@1MillSaviour @LamboERC As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

3. Hasty Generalization: This fallacy exists in posts that hastily generalize the potential success of a cryptocurrency based on vague and unverified claims, without providing concrete evidence or reasoning.

Example Post: ""@MattWallace888 @elonmusk @RonDeSantis @GovRonDeSantis As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

These posts rely on fallacious reasoning to promote the cryptocurrency ""pepa"" and create a sense of urgency or FOMO (fear of missing out) among readers. It's essential to critically evaluate information and make informed decisions rather than falling for logical fallacies.","This set of tweets is focused on promoting a specific cryptocurrency called $pepa and discussing its potential for a bull run, particularly in the Chinese market. The language used includes references to specific crypto influencers such as CZ, as well as terms like ""meme coin,"" ""bullrun,"" and ""Chinese marketing."" The culture implied by these tweets is that of the cryptocurrency community and investors who are familiar with terms and concepts related to trading, crypto markets, and potential price movements. This in-group language is used to signal to others within the crypto community that $pepa is a valuable investment opportunity and to create a sense of urgency around purchasing the coin before the anticipated bull run.","1.

- Mention of Marcos in some of the tweets","1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade by citing a famous person or authority figure, rather than providing evidence or reasoning. In this case, the use of hashtags and tagging specific accounts suggests that the opinion of these accounts holds weight simply because they are well-known or have a large following.
Example post: @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

An example of this fallacy can be seen in the tweet: ""The USS Florida, an Ohio-Class Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missile Submarine has reportedly transited the Suez Canal and entered Territorial Waters near the Middle East in order to 'Support the Stability and Security' of the Region."" The tweet attacks the action of the USS Florida without addressing the actual argument or reasoning behind the action.

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure rather than providing valid evidence or reasoning. An example of this fallacy can be seen in the tweet: ""Bill Gates: The Ukrainian government is one of the worst in the world, a corrupt government, controlled by a few rich oligarchs, unfortunately for the Ukrainian people."" The tweet relies on Bill Gates' opinion as an authority figure without providing further evidence to support the claim.

Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when someone uses emotional manipulation to sway the audience rather than providing logical reasoning. An example of this fallacy can be seen in the tweet: ""Taiwan is currently fully encircled by the Chinese military. This includes 9 Chinese destroyers, an aircraft carrier, 71 fighter jets, and missile launchers."" The tweet is intended to evoke fear or anxiety about the situation without providing a balanced or logical analysis.

Circular Reasoning: This fallacy occurs when someone uses their conclusion as a premise in their argument. An example of this fallacy can be seen in the tweet: ""What does #XiJinping‚Äôs third term as #CCP chief and Central Military Commission chair mean for the #Chinese armed forces?"" The tweet assumes that Xi Jinping's third term will have a specific impact on the armed forces without providing evidence or reasoning to support this claim.","1.
