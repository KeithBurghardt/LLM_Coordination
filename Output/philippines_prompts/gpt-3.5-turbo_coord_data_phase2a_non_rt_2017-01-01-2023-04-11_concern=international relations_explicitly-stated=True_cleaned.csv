United Kingdom,Russia,The type of political goal for the posts is Anti-Tory sentiment and promoting a General Election.,"The political goal of the information operation is to discredit and undermine the Conservative Party and its leadership, particularly Boris Johnson, in order to call for a General Election and push for a change in government.",The description of the information operation for the posts is an anti-Tory disinformation campaign.,December,"The major themes from the posts include criticism of the Conservative Party for corruption, lies, and venality, calls for a general election to remove the Tories from power, accusations of greed and misconduct among Tory politicians, and the negative impact of Tory policies on society and the environment.","1. Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists in several of the posts where individuals are attacking the Tory party and its members personally instead of focusing on the actual policies or issues at hand.
Example: ""@Esscrew @LBC @Scrabble817 It isn’t, or wasn’t until Johnson, like Trump infected & corrupted every department, every corner of Govt & the civil service with his sordid lies, deep corruption & despicable venality. #ToryCorruption #FailedState #ToryBrexitDisaster #ToriesUnfitForOffice #GeneralElectionNow""

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy can be seen in multiple posts where individuals are urging others to join the anti-Tory movement without providing solid reasons or evidence for their claims.
Example: ""🎶There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in town🎶 #FollowBackAntiTory #GTTO #EnoughlsEnough #GeneralStrike #UpRise #UniteB1 #BuckTories #GeneralElectionNow #ToriesOut228""

3. Appeal to Emotions: Many of the posts appeal to emotions by using strong language, insults, and exaggerated claims to provoke a response rather than presenting rational arguments.
Example: ""@Saccaguru @GOV2UK Morning Saccaguru 🙏✊ Nothing really surprises me about Tories - They are corrupt to the Core they thrive on corruption sleaze lies creating divisions in society….that is the Tory way. Why ppl still vote for them is beyond me. #ToriesOut208 #GeneralElectionNow #GeneralStrikeNow""

4. Ad Populum: This fallacy is present in posts where individuals appeal to popular opinion or the masses to support their anti-Tory stance without providing substantive evidence or reasoning.
Example: ""🎶There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in town🎶 #FollowBackSunday #TorySewageParty #EnoughlsEnough #UniteB1 #BuckTories #UpRise #GeneralElectionNow #ToriesOut262""

5. Straw Man: This fallacy is evident in posts where individuals misrepresent the Tory party's arguments or positions to make them easier to attack.
Example: ""#LeaveLiedAndBrokeTheLawAndAreNowUKgov - they belong in jail, regressive, destructive, greed-driven& corrupt; nothing will change until we send the Tories packing #GeneralElectionNow""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include hashtags such as #ToryCorruption, #CorruptConservatives, #FailedState, #ToriesUnfitForOffice, #GeneralElectionNow, #BuckTories, #TorySewageParty, #SaveOurNHS, #GTTO, #EnoughIsEnough, #ToriesOut, #Putin'sBrexit, #BBCBias, #GeneralStrike, #LeaveLiedAndBrokeTheLawAndAreNowUKgov, #NonDom, #GreenCard, #ToryBrexitDisaster, #PRasap, #JailTheTories, #GeneralStrikeNow, #GTTO, #GTTONow, #CorruptToriesOut, #PutinsBrexit, #UpRise, and #SunakTheLiar.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is strongly opposed to the Conservative Party in the UK (referred to as Tories) and views them as corrupt, harmful, and responsible for various societal issues. They are calling for a general election to remove the Tories from power and believe in a united front against them, as shown by hashtags like #GTTO (Get The Tories Out) and #UniteB1.

- Example: ""If we don't take military action against Country X, they will surely attack us and endanger our citizens.""

2. ""Everyone knows that Country Y is the most corrupt country in the world, so we should not engage in any negotiations with them.""

Australia,Australia,Sow discord and division,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to sow division and create confusion by spreading disinformation and attacking political figures and policies related to international relations.,This information operation involves spreading disinformation and propaganda on the topic of international relations.,August,"The major themes from these posts are calls for resignation due to perceived incompetence and corruption in government, criticism of international treaties and agreements, skepticism towards government actions in international relations, and accusations of mismanagement of funds and lack of ideas in relation to international affairs.","1. Ad Hominem - This fallacy is present in the first three posts, as the individuals targeted in the tweets are attacked personally rather than addressing their arguments or actions. For example, calling @YvetteDAth a ""dud"" and accusing her of corruption is attacking her character rather than discussing her policies or decisions.

2. Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy can be seen in the tweets that use emotive language such as ""resign #dud #corruption #thevibe #qldpol"" to evoke strong negative feelings towards the individuals mentioned. The emotional appeal is meant to influence the audience rather than provide a logical argument.

3. Straw Man - This fallacy is present in tweets that misrepresent the positions or arguments of the individuals mentioned. For example, in the tweet directed at @AnnastaciaMP, the straw man fallacy is used by suggesting that if Brisbane were a union worksite with deaths occurring, the reaction would be different. This misrepresents the actual actions or responses of the individual.

Example: 
Hi @YvetteDAth 👋 Are you working the phones tonight? Calling in those favours from your Attorney-General days? It won’t be enough. You’re in the exit lane. The only questions are how, & how many you take with you. Resign #dud #corruption #thevibe #qldpol https://t.co/sPid4XcUWb

It also aims to highlight alleged corruption, support for foreign interference, and anti-Indigenous actions within the CPC.","Information operation focused on spreading disinformation and propaganda about the Conservative Party of Canada, particularly targeting Pierre Poilievre. #DisinformationCampaign #Propaganda #CPC_Targeting",The starting month of the information operation is May.,"The major themes from the posts include:
- Concern about Russia winning propaganda and culture wars in the West
- Criticism of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members, particularly Pierre Poilievre
- Allegations of election interference and political corruption
- Criticism of the CPC's behavior and stance on various issues
- Criticism of media bias and misinformation influencing public opinion in favor of the CPC
- Criticism of corruption and incompetence in Canadian politics, including by the CPC and other parties","1. Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy exists in the first post that states, ""Russia is winning the propaganda and culture wars in the West! Very soon, most western countries will be run the same way Russia is run."" The use of words like ""winning"" and ""culture wars"" are designed to evoke strong emotions and fear in the readers.

2. Ad Hominem - The post by @LeslynLewis includes the hashtag ""#PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou"" which attacks the character of Pierre Poilievre instead of addressing the actual arguments or issues at hand.

3. Ad Hominem - The post by @PierrePoilievre with the hashtag ""#PierrePoilievreIsBroken"" attacks the character of Pierre Poilievre by suggesting he is broken, instead of engaging with the content of his message.

4. Straw Man - The tweet by @LeslynLewis accuses the Conservative Party of owning fat shaming, suggesting suicide, threats, bigotry, homophobia, and misogyny. This misrepresents the party's platform and positions to create a false argument.

5. Appeal to Authority - The tweet by @vee_terra mentions specific politicians and uses emojis like 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 to praise their actions. This appeals to authority figures in an attempt to persuade others.

6. False Equivalence - @SusanFDe accuses media outlets of misleading the public for Con votes, alleging election meddling. This creates a false equivalence between media coverage and political corruption without solid evidence.

7. Ad Populum - The tweet by @politicskid12 attempts to appeal to the public by stating, ""NOPE to stop the money we pay in taxes from being stolen and transferred to predatory capitalists by Corrupt Premiers."" This appeals to popular sentiment without providing substantive evidence.

8. Ad Baculum - The tweet by @allogan2 accuses both the BC NDP and Con Premiers of corruption and incompetence without providing specific evidence, potentially using fear tactics to discredit them.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a conservative political culture in Canada, particularly within the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its supporters. 

The hashtags #CdnPoli, #CPC, #CPCNonsense, and references to specific conservative politicians like Pierre Poilievre and Leslyn Lewis indicate an in-group language used by individuals who are part of or aligned with the CPC. Terms like ""ElectionInterference"" and ""CorruptionGreedandLies"" suggest a skepticism or criticism of the political establishment, particularly towards the Liberal Party of Canada and the mainstream media.

References to specific politicians and allegations of misconduct, such as Pierre Poilievre's acceptance of ""free travel"" from Chinese sponsors, contribute to the in-group culture of holding politicians and party members accountable for their actions. There is also a focus on issues of political correctness, ideological purity, and integrity within the conservative movement, as seen in the criticisms of the CPC's handling of fat shaming, suicide suggestions, bigotry, and misogyny.

Overall, the culture implied in these posts is one of political activism, dissent, and a desire for transparency and accountability within the Canadian conservative political landscape.

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: Several posts mention ""#MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023"" and ""#Marcos y #Julieta"" in a positive light, potentially appealing to the bandwagon fallacy by suggesting that because many others are talking about these topics, they are worth discussing or supporting.

Example: ""#MarcosGH2023 #Marcos https://t.co/aCRTVXpPED""

2. Appeal to Emotions: Posts that repeatedly use emoticons like 😍, 😊, 👑💞, 🍻, 🎤👏, 🎶, etc., appeal to the emotions of the audience rather than providing logical reasoning or evidence related to the topic of international relations.

3. Appeal to Tradition: Posts that mention ""#GH2022 #marcos"" and ""#GH22 #GH2022 #GH2023 #GH23 #GranHermano"" repeatedly may be appealing to tradition, suggesting that these topics have been discussed in the past and should continue to be the focus without considering new information or perspectives.

Appeal to Emotions: These tweets may be trying to evoke a sense of fear or excitement in the reader by using words like ""new threat,"" ""city of the dead,"" and ""escape."" This fallacy exists because the tweets are appealing to the reader's emotions rather than presenting objective information. Example: ""With a new threat rising out of the swarms, Mace knows it will take every ounce of strength and courage they can muster to escape the city of the dead.""

2. Bandwagon: The tweets are using phrases like ""NOW AVAILABLE!"" and ""mustread"" to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, trying to make the reader feel like they should be part of the trend of reading this book. This fallacy exists because it is trying to pressure the reader into following the crowd. Example: ""NOW AVAILABLE! #FREE #KindleUnlimited With a new threat rising out of the swarms, Mace knows it will take every ounce of strength and courage they can muster to escape the city of the dead.""

3. Appeal to Authority: The tweets use the presence of a review and high ratings (e.g., ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️) to establish credibility and persuade the reader that the book is worth reading. This fallacy exists because it relies on the authority of the reviewer to convince the reader. Example: ""Uvi ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A body was found in Laguna Beach this morning… review #suspense #thriller.""

4. Appeal to Popularity: The tweets use hashtags like #horror and #zombies to align the book with popular genres and trends, suggesting that because these themes are popular, the book must be worth reading.

2. Appeal to Tradition: The tweet ""We ❤ #OMotherDear! #BamaState4ever!"" is appealing to tradition by emphasizing the love for their alma mater and using the hashtag #BamaState4ever to indicate a long-standing loyalty.

Example post: ""I can't believe anyone would support the Female Republic Elders 🦅🦅🎤🎤🎤, they are clearly the best choice for leadership!""

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in the second post as it seems to be trying to jump on the trend or popularity of talking about Swarm without providing any substantial information or argument.

- Fallacy: Ethnocentrism
- Explanation: Ethnocentrism is the belief that one's own culture or country is superior and should be the standard for others.

- Example post: ""The United States should not get involved in conflicts overseas. We need to prioritize our own interests first.""

2. ""It's clear that Country X is the biggest threat to global peace. We must take immediate action to stop them before it's too late.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Fear
- Explanation: This fallacy involves using fear to persuade others to agree with a certain viewpoint or take a specific action.

- Example post: ""If we don't intervene in Country X's affairs now, they will unleash chaos and destruction on the world.""

Post 2: ""Just got back from an amazing vacation in Spain. The food and sights were unforgettable! #travelgoals""

Similarly, this post employs a distract tactic by talking about a personal experience (vacation in Spain) instead of engaging with the topic of international relations.

- Fallacy: Ethnocentrism
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it promotes the belief that one's own country or culture is superior to others.
- Example: ""America is the greatest country in the world, we don't need to concern ourselves with helping other nations. Let them figure it out on their own.""

2. ""I read an article that said the United Nations is corrupt and biased towards certain countries. We shouldn't trust their decisions or rely on them for international cooperation.""

- Fallacy: Confirmation Bias
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it only considers information that supports a pre-existing belief, ignoring any evidence to the contrary.
- Example: ""I knew the United Nations was corrupt, this article just confirms what I already suspected.""

3. ""We can't trust any foreign leader to keep their promises or agreements. They're all just out for themselves and will betray us in the end.""

- Fallacy: Generalization
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it makes a broad, sweeping statement about all foreign leaders without considering individual differences or specific circumstances.
- Example: ""Every foreign leader is a snake in the grass, we can't trust any of them to uphold their end of the deal.""

4. ""The only way to achieve peace between nations is through military strength and intimidation. Diplomacy is just a sign of weakness.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Force
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it relies on the use of threats or force to achieve a desired outcome, rather than peaceful negotiation and diplomacy.
- Example: ""We need to show our military might to make other countries comply with our demands. Peace through strength is the only way.""

5. ""If we don't retaliate against this attack, we'll look weak and other countries will think they can walk all over us. We have to show them we mean business.""

- Fallacy: Slippery Slope
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it exaggerates the potential consequences of a decision or action, leading to the belief that one small step will inevitably lead to a much larger, negative outcome.
- Example: ""If we don't retaliate now, other countries will see us as weak and start attacking us left and right. We have to show them we won't back down.""","1.

2. Tweet: ""The United Nations is useless, they never do anything to stop wars or help those in need.""
Fallacy: Hasty Generalization

Example: ""The United Nations is a waste of taxpayer money, they never accomplish anything meaningful.""

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or has widespread acceptance, it must be correct. In this case, the repetitive use of ""Welcome"" and ""Signed"" in the posts may create a sense of momentum or popularity.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves manipulating an emotional response to distract from the actual issue at hand. The use of exclamation points and positive language such as ""Welcome"" could be seen as an attempt to evoke positive emotions from the audience.

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy is based on the assumption that because something has been done a certain way in the past, it should continue to be done that way. The hashtag ""#Swarm23ason l #EarnIT"" suggests a tradition or pattern of behavior that is expected to continue.
