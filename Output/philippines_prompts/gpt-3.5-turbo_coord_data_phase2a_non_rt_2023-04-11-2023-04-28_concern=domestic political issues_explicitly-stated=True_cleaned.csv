2. Appeal to Tradition:
The post ""Actually all Engineers laugh hysterically whenever any corrupt politician talks abt corruption..."" relies on the idea that because engineers have always known about corruption in politics, it must be true.

3. Appeal to Authority:

4. Hasty Generalization:
The post ""Nearly 40-50% of Gov't money is spent thru Engineers hence u cannot do any corruption without their knowledge"" makes a broad generalization about engineers and their involvement in government corruption based on limited or insufficient evidence.

Political goal: Discredit the opposition party and undermine their support among the working class.",Coordinated disinformation campaign targeting political opinion.,June,"1. ""Struggling to understand the current political climate in our country. So much division and animosity among our leaders. Can we find a way to come together and truly work for the common good?""

3. ""It's disheartening to see how corruption and self-interests often drive domestic politics. We need leaders who are truly dedicated to serving the people and upholding democratic values."" 

Major Themes:
1. Division and animosity among political leaders
2. Finding common ground for the common good
3. Complexity and contentious nature of political issues
4. Corruption and self-interest in politics
5. Need for dedicated leaders serving the people and upholding democratic values","Post 1: ""All politicians are corrupt. Therefore, I will not vote in the upcoming election.""

Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization
Explanation: This post makes a broad generalization about all politicians being corrupt based on the actions of a few.
Example: ""All politicians are corrupt. I read a news article about one politician taking a bribe, so they must all be the same.""

Post 2: ""If you don't support my candidate, you're clearly uninformed and ignorant.""

Fallacy: Ad Hominem
Explanation: This post attacks the person's intelligence or knowledge rather than addressing the actual argument or issue.
Example: ""You must be ignorant if you don't support my candidate. Only people who are uninformed would make such a decision.""

Post 3: ""If we don't pass this bill, the economy will collapse and millions of people will lose their jobs.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Consequence
Explanation: This post tries to push the idea that a certain action must be taken because of the negative consequences that may occur if it's not taken.
Example: ""If we don't pass this bill, the entire country will suffer a catastrophic economic collapse. We can't take that risk.""

Post 4: ""Everyone I know is voting for this candidate, so you should too.""

Fallacy: Ad Populum
Explanation: This post appeals to the popularity or majority opinion to persuade others to follow the same course of action.
Example: ""All my friends and family are voting for this candidate, so they must be the best choice. Join us and don't be left out.""

Post 5: ""If you don't support this policy, you're clearly heartless and don't care about those in need.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Emotions
Explanation: This post tries to manipulate emotions, such as guilt or pity, to win support for a certain policy or viewpoint.
Example: ""Anyone who doesn't support this policy clearly doesn't care about the less fortunate. How could you turn your back on those in need?""","1. ""Yas queen! The shade being thrown in that debate was everything. #winning #savage""

In this post, the cultural cue of using ""yas queen"" and referring to ""shade"" being thrown in a debate indicates that the in-group implied is likely from the LGBTQ+ community or individuals who are familiar with and active in LGBTQ+ culture and slang. The use of hashtags like #winning and #savage also suggests a younger, internet-savvy demographic.

2. ""The government needs to stop gaslighting the American people with their fake news and alternative facts. We demand transparency and justice! #resist #truth""

The use of the terms ""gaslighting,"" ""fake news,"" ""alternative facts,"" and the hashtag #resist suggest that the cultural cues and in-group language being used are commonly associated with members of the progressive or liberal political sphere. This likely implies individuals who are critical of the current government and its handling of domestic political issues.","1. ""Freedom of speech""

Post 3: ""Did you know that healthcare costs have skyrocketed in the past few years? It's time to address this issue and make sure everyone has access to affordable care. #HealthcareForAll""

In this case, Post 3 uses an Engage tactic by bringing up the related topic of healthcare costs in relation to the broader issue of domestic political issues.

4. ""We must come together as a nation to address systemic racism and injustice in our society. #DomesticIssues #SocialJustice"" 

5. ""Investing in renewable energy and sustainability is key to tackling climate change and creating jobs in our country. #DomesticIssues #GreenNewDeal""

Post 3 uses an Explain tactic by providing details on a specific policy proposal (universal basic income) as a solution to combat poverty in the country. This post elaborates on the topic by offering a potential solution and explaining how it can address the issue at hand.","Without actual posts provided, I can't determine which, if any, posts use an Excite tactic.

2. ""I am fed up with the current state of our political system. It's time for real change and reform.""
3. ""I support candidates who prioritize addressing domestic political issues and putting the needs of the people first.""
4. ""It's important for us to stay informed and engaged in discussions about domestic political issues. Our voices matter!"" 

Post #4 uses an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing domestic political issues and stay engaged in the conversation. It emphasizes the importance of staying informed and using our voices to make a difference.","Without knowing the specific content of the posts, it is difficult to definitively identify which, if any, use a Distort tactic.

Please provide the specific posts so that they can be analyzed for any use of negative emotions to elicit a response.","Post 1: ""Our education system is failing our children.

Post 3: ""Did you see the latest episode of that popular TV show? I can't get enough of the drama and plot twists!""

Post 4: ""The economy is in a downward spiral and we need to come up with solutions to stimulate growth and create jobs for Americans.""

The use of 🔥🔥🔥 and exclamation marks in the posts further emphasizes this appeal to emotions.

- Ad Hominem: While the specific individuals mentioned in the post are not attacked, the overall message seems to imply that the DOJ officials colluding with the CCP are traitors, engaging in corruption. This can be seen as an attempt to discredit their character rather than focusing on the actual issues at hand. Example: ""We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice(DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""

- Loaded Language: The use of terms like ""traitors"" and ""collusion"" loaded with negative connotations can be considered as an example of this fallacy in the post.

United States,Country: Russia,Divide and polarize the population.,Inflame tensions between political parties.,Covert propaganda promoting certain political narratives.,March,"1. ""The current political climate is becoming increasingly polarized, with both sides refusing to engage in productive dialogue and compromise.""

2. ""Corruption within our government continues to be a major issue, with politicians putting their own interests above those of the people they were elected to serve.""

3. ""Many citizens feel disillusioned with the political system and believe that their voices are not being heard or represented by those in power.""

The major themes from these posts are political polarization, government corruption, and disillusionment with the political system.","1. ""All politicians are corrupt, so it doesn't matter who I vote for.""
   - Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization
   - Explanation: This statement makes a sweeping generalization by assuming that all politicians are corrupt without considering individual differences.
   - Example: ""All cats are mean, so I don't want to adopt any cat as a pet.""

2. ""If you don't support my political party, you must be unpatriotic.""
   - Fallacy: Ad Hominem
   - Explanation: This statement attacks the character of those who do not support the speaker's political party rather than addressing the argument itself.
   - Example: ""You're just a selfish person, that's why you don't agree with me.""

3. ""Everyone I know is voting for this candidate, so they must be the best choice.""
   - Fallacy: Ad Populum
   - Explanation: This statement appeals to popular opinion rather than relying on sound reasoning or evidence.
   - Example: ""All my friends are doing it, so it must be cool.""

4. ""If we don't elect this candidate, our country will spiral into chaos.""
   - Fallacy: Slippery Slope
   - Explanation: This statement presents a chain of events that are unlikely or exaggerated as a way to scare people into supporting a particular viewpoint.
   - Example: ""If we allow students to have cell phones in class, they will stop paying attention, fail their classes, and never succeed in life.""

5. ""You can't trust anything the media says about the government, they're all controlled by the same people.""
   - Fallacy: Conspiracy Theory
   - Explanation: This statement relies on a conspiracy theory that all media outlets are controlled by the same entity, without providing any evidence for such a claim.
   - Example: ""The government is hiding the truth about aliens living among us.""","Post 1: ""The deep state is at it again, trying to undermine our elected officials. We need to stay vigilant and protect our democracy.""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""deep state,"" ""protect our democracy""

Implied culture/in-group: This language suggests a belief in conspiracy theories or a distrust of government institutions. The in-group may be individuals who are critical of the government and believe in the idea of a ""deep state"" working against elected officials.


Post 2: ""The resistance is growing stronger every day, fighting back against the oppressive policies of the current administration. #Resist""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""resistance,"" ""oppressive policies,"" #Resist

Implied culture/in-group: This language indicates a group of individuals who are opposed to the current administration and see themselves as part of a larger resistance movement. The in-group may include activists, progressives, or those who identify with leftist political ideologies.","1. ""Today in Congress, the rhetoric coming from both parties was filled with accusatory language and finger-pointing.""
2. ""The politician's use of euphemistic language to downplay the impact of the new policy is concerning.""
3. ""I am tired of the polarizing language being used in debates - can't we find a middle ground?""
4. ""The candidate's campaign speech was full of buzzwords and empty promises, it was hard to take them seriously.""","1. ""Our economy is in shambles and all our government can do is argue about petty issues. It's time for real leadership in this country.""
2. ""I can't believe how divided our country has become over issues that should be easily solvable. We need to find common ground and move forward together.""
3. ""It's time to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions and put an end to the corruption and greed that plagues our political system."" 

Post 2 uses the Engage tactic by bringing up the related but relevant topic of finding common ground and moving forward together amidst the division in the country over domestic political issues.",There are no posts provided to analyze.,"Without seeing the specific tweets, it may be difficult to determine which, if any, posts use an Excite tactic. However, if a post includes language that evokes a sense of hope, motivation, or pride in a political cause or candidate, it may be using an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement. This could include messages about progress, unity, or positive change within the domestic political landscape.","1. ""We need to address these domestic political issues in order to create a better future for our country. #domesticpolitics #change""

2. ""I'm proud to be part of a group that is actively working to address the pressing domestic political issues facing our nation. #politicalactivism #domesticpolitics""

3. ""Let's not shy away from discussing the tough domestic political issues that are affecting our communities. We have the power to make a difference. #empowerment #change"" 

4. ""It's time for us to come together and find solutions to the domestic political issues that are dividing our country. #unity #progress"" 

The tweets that use an Enhance tactic are:

1. ""We need to address these domestic political issues in order to create a better future for our country. #domesticpolitics #change"" 

3. ""Let's not shy away from discussing the tough domestic political issues that are affecting our communities. We have the power to make a difference. #empowerment #change"" 

Both of these tweets are encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing and addressing domestic political issues in order to bring about positive change and make a difference.","Without seeing the actual posts, it is difficult to identify which ones may be using a Distort tactic. However, examples of Distort tactics in discussing domestic political issues could include misrepresenting facts, taking quotes out of context, or presenting biased information in order to manipulate the audience's perception of the issue. It would be necessary to review the specific content of the posts in question to determine if any of them are using a Distort tactic.","Without the actual tweets provided, it is impossible to determine which posts use a Dismay tactic. However, if there are tweets that evoke negative emotions such as sadness or anger in relation to domestic political issues, those would likely be utilizing a Dismay tactic. These types of posts are meant to provoke strong reactions from the audience and can be effective in shaping opinions and swaying public sentiment.","Post 1: ""I can't believe how low the unemployment rate is right now, it's great to see our economy booming!""

Post 2: ""Did you hear about that new movie coming out next month? I can't wait to see it, the trailer looks amazing!""

Post 3: ""I think we need to focus on improving our healthcare system, it's such an important issue that affects so many people.""

Posts 1 and 2 use the distract tactic by discussing completely irrelevant topics like the unemployment rate and a new movie, instead of focusing on domestic political issues. These posts divert attention away from the main topic at hand, which is domestic political issues, and could be seen as an attempt to steer the conversation in a different direction. This tactic can be used to avoid engaging with difficult or contentious political issues and instead shift the focus to more neutral or positive subjects.",24,[],"1.

Appeal to Emotions: The tweets are appealing to the emotions of the reader by congratulating the team and using celebratory language like ""GREAT JOB"" and emojis to evoke a positive reaction. This fallacy exists because emotions are being used to persuade rather than logical reasoning.

Example: ""Congratulations guys. GREAT JOB! GET DEM W's. #CollegeBaseball #SWAC #HBCU #BAMASTATE #SWARMAS1 🖤💛🐝⚾️🔥🔥🔥🔥""

2. Appeal to Tradition: The tweets mention traditional practices and events related to sports at the university. This fallacy exists because the appeal is based on the idea that things should be done a certain way because they have always been done that way.

Example: ""BB| Friday Night vibes from Wheeler-Watkins 💪 #SWARMAS1 | #IAMSWAC""

3. Appeal to Authority: The tweets mention the achievements of players and coaches, highlighting their success. This fallacy exists because the authority of the players and coaches is being used to persuade rather than relying on logical arguments.

Example: ""Congratulations to Head Coach Anuk Christiansz on being named @theswac Tournament Coach of the Year for the 2nd year in a row! 🥳 #IAMSWAC | #SWARMAS1""

4. Bandwagon: The tweets include hashtags and phrases encouraging support for the team, creating a sense of unity and belonging with the team's fanbase. This fallacy exists because it appeals to the desire to be part of a popular or successful group.

Example: ""This is how you sweep a series! 🐝🐝🐝 #SWARMandSTING https://t.co/owxMQS9JAw""

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,Destabilization efforts against Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.,"The political goal of the information operation in these tweets is to pressure leaders like Macron, Borrell, Biden, and Blinken to take action against the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan for their alleged aggressions against the Armenian people. The operation aims to advocate for sanctions against Aliyev and highlights issues of democracy and ethnic cleansing.",Covert influence operation amplifying anti-Azerbaijan sentiment.,March,"The major themes from the posts are: 
- Aggressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people
- Democracy and ethnic cleaning being at stake
- Calls for the stopping of the Artsakh blockade and sanctions against Aliyev
- Criticism of the Aliyev regime and accusations of war crimes","1. Appeal to Authority Fallacy - In the first post, the user tags several political figures and organizations, appealing to them to take action against the Aliyev regime. They are assuming that these authorities have the power to stop the escalating aggressions, but this may not necessarily be the case.
Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @JosepBorrellF @POTUS @SecBlinken agressions from the Aliyev regime on armenian people keep escalating despite your calls and the @CIJ_ICJ decision. Democracy and ethnic cleaning are at stake #StopArtsakhBlockade #SanctionAliyev""

2. Ad Hominem Fallacy - In the second post, the user attacks Taras, labeling him as a racist without addressing the arguments or points he may have made. This is an attempt to discredit Taras rather than engage in a meaningful discussion.
Example: ""@TarasKuzio Anti Armenian racist Taras complaining about every country except his two best buddies fascist Erdogan and Aliyev. Good job racist. https://t.co/ulKGo1Vp9Q""

3. Non Sequitur Fallacy - In the fourth post, the user accuses Aliyev of starting EU education of Azerbaijan Military and Diplomatic practices without providing any evidence or explanation of how these actions relate to the escalating aggressions against Armenian people.
Example: ""Aliyev has started EU education of Azerbaijan Military and Diplomatic practices : Reverse Victimisation, Blackmail and Attack ! At the state of the Art Négociation. #AliyevDictatorship #WarCrimed #HaitredPolicy #SanctionAliyevAutocracy""

4. False Equivalence Fallacy - In the eighth post, the user equates Azerbaijan with a hatred Autocracy promoting war crimes against ethnic Armenians. This oversimplifies the complex situation and paints Azerbaijan in a completely negative light without acknowledging any potential complexities or nuances.
Example: ""@UNHumanRights @antonioguterres Azerbaijan is a hatred Autocracy, promoting #WarCrimes against ethnic Armenians. Rewarding Worst tortures, Decapitation of Civilians and POWs. @UN advocacy pro #Aliyev Regime IS unacceptable! #StopArtsakhBlockade""

5. Straw Man Fallacy - In the twelfth post, the user misrepresents Taras Kuzio's views and positions him as supportive of beheadings if the victims are not Ukrainian. This straw man argument diverts attention from the actual points made by Taras and creates a false representation of his beliefs.

3. China's military modernization and institutional changes.
4. India-China relations and border disputes.

Ad Hominem: This fallacy might exist in the post, ""With France and Germany devoid of any significant military prowess, the EU's reliance on the US is a strategic imperative, says Harsh V Pant."" The argument is attacking France and Germany's lack of military prowess rather than addressing the actual issue at hand.

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy can be found in the post, ""Under President Marcos, the Philippines is keen to strengthen the country’s maritime security capabilities and improve its defence network in the region, notes @DonMcLainGill95."" The argument relies on the authority of President Marcos to support the proposed policies without providing substantial evidence or reasoning.
