Example of post: ""i really thank all of you bc you're the reason huang xuxi exists now & i have the motivation to go forward"" #WeLoveYouLucas""

3. Appeal to the Masses: The posts appeal to the masses by suggesting that everyone should show support for Huang Xuxi.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely a fan group or fandom related to the K-pop industry or a specific K-pop artist, possibly Lucas, Wong Yukhei, and Huang Xuxi. The use of nicknames and hashtags related to supporting and expressing love for these artists suggests a shared interest and sense of belonging within this fan community.","- Lucas

They quote Lucas thanking fans for their support and motivation, which can further engage and encourage fans to continue showing their love for the idols.","The second and third posts use a Distort tactic as they are repeating the same message multiple times without adding any new information. This tactic is used to create the illusion of widespread support or interest in a topic that may not actually be important or relevant. In this case, the topic of missing Lucas, Wong Yukhei, and Huang Xuxi may not be considered important to a wider audience.","All three posts are part of a coordinated campaign expressing love and support for Lucas, Wong Yukhei, and Huang Xuxi. There does not appear to be any use of a Distort tactic in these posts.",The first post uses a Dismay tactic as it expresses sadness about missing Lucas.,"The second and third posts use the Distract tactic.

This can be seen in the statement ""You're just a stupid liberal, so your opinion doesn't matter.""

Example: ""I can't take anything you say seriously because you're a woman.""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure rather than providing evidence or reasoning to support their argument.

3. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because a majority of people believe something, it must be true.

4. False Cause: This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because one event happened before another, it must have caused it.

Example: ""I wore my lucky socks and we won the game, so my socks must be the reason we won.""

5. Straw Man: This fallacy occurs when someone distorts or exaggerates an opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack.

These posts also suggest a sense of community among fans who are sharing their excitement and admiration for Marcos.","In the given posts, we can identify a few fallacies:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or widely believed, it must be true. The posts using hashtags like #MarcosGH, #MarcosGinocchio, etc., and celebrating Marcos, could be seen as appealing to the popularity of Marcos without providing valid reasoning or evidence.

Example of post: RT @fhckthwrld Felicidades Marcos Ginocchio! LINE Popture Awards 2023 üî•TOP CRUSH INTERNACIONAL #MarcosGinocchio #MARCOSGH 

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves manipulating emotions in order to win an argument. Posts using emotional language, like ""Pobrecito"" or ""Felicidades Marcos Ginocchio,"" are appealing to emotions rather than logical reasoning.

Example of post: RT @PrimoMarcosG ""Pobrecito"" akskaak MARCOS EN MASTERCHEF

3. Ad Hominem: This fallacy involves attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. While not explicitly present in the given posts, the focus on Marcos and the use of his name repeatedly could potentially lead to personal attacks or biases rather than rational discussion.

These fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotions, popularity, and personal attacks rather than logical reasoning or evidence to support their claims.","1. ""MarcosGinocchio""

Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. 
Example: ""You're just a teenager, what do you know about politics?""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy happens when someone claims something is true because an authority figure says it is true.
Example: ""Dr. Smith said that climate change is a hoax, so it must be true.""

Example: ""My opponent thinks we should completely open our borders to immigrants, which would be disastrous for our country.""

4. Slippery Slope: This fallacy happens when someone argues that a small, seemingly harmless action will inevitably lead to a much bigger, negative outcome.
Example: ""If we legalize marijuana, soon everyone will be using drugs and society will collapse.""

Appeal to Authority - This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure rather than providing sound reasoning or evidence to support their argument.

Example post: ""Well-known scientist Dr. Smith says that climate change is not a real problem, so we should not worry about it.""

2. Ad Hominem - This fallacy involves attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself.

Example post: ""You shouldn't listen to John's opinion on the matter because he's a terrible person.""

3. False Cause - This fallacy occurs when a causal connection is assumed without proper evidence to support it.

Example post: ""Every time I wear my lucky socks, my team wins. Therefore, my lucky socks are the reason we are winning.""

4. Straw Man - This fallacy involves misrepresenting or exaggerating someone's argument in order to make it easier to attack.

Example post: ""Those who support stricter gun control laws just want to take away our Second Amendment rights and leave us defenseless against criminals.""

5. Hasty Generalization - This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence.

Example post: ""I met a rude person from New York once, so all New Yorkers must be rude.""","1. ""Just saw that new Marvel movie, it was straight fire üî• #AvengersAssemble""

Explanation: This fallacy attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the tweet by Benjamin Norton accuses the US government of authoritarian crackdown on free speech, using emotional language and invoking McCarthyism and racism without directly addressing the issue at hand - the members of the African People‚Äôs Socialist Party facing charges.
Example: RT @BenjaminNorton Authoritarian crackdown on free speech in the US: 3 members of the African People‚Äôs Socialist Party face 15 years in prison for supposedly helping Russia spread ""disinfo"" about NATO's proxy war in Ukraine McCarthyism + racism

Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
Explanation: This fallacy relies on the authority of a person or source rather than the validity of the argument itself. The post by @samirsaran refers to a discussion involving several individuals, some of whom are tagged in the post, to discuss the conflict between China and Taiwan. The argument is based on the authority of these individuals rather than concrete evidence or logical reasoning.
Example: RT @samirsaran #China sees #Taiwan as a historic mission. But if it provokes a conflict, it will stand to lose a lot. @carlbildt @_DaniloTurk @Peter_Beyer @SujanChinoy @LynnKuok @raji143 discuss at #Raisina2023 @raisinadialogue @orfonline

Fallacy: Circular Reasoning
Explanation: This fallacy occurs when the conclusion of the argument is already assumed in the premises. The tweet by @ORFMumbai reflects this fallacy as it presents a brief by the same authors examining the efforts of India and Nepal to resolve border conflicts without providing any evidence or new information, essentially repeating the same information as the premise.
