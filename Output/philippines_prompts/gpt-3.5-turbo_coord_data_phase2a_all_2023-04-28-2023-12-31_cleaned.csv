The topic of explicit content is inappropriate and not suitable for public discussion. While none of the posts use a Dismiss tactic explicitly, the nature of the content itself is dismissive of societal norms and decency."
Australia,Australia,"Discrediting political opponents, Anti-corruption, Anti-treaty","Goal: Spread disinformation and propaganda aimed at casting doubt on the integrity of the Labor party in Australia and its leader Anthony Albanese, as well as fuel divisions in Australian society by stoking fear and resentment around issues of race and government corruption.","Disinformation campaign with anti-Labor, anti-Treaty, anti-corruption themes.",January,"Corruption, political deception, the dangers of communism, Australian political history, the influence of China, and the impact of colonialism are the major themes present in the posts.","1. Ad Hominem: The tweet suggests that Albanese and Thorpe are liars without any evidence to support this claim, attacking their character rather than their arguments or actions.
Example: ""Albanese is a known liar and Thorpe is a known liar.""

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet tries to evoke a negative emotional response towards Albanese by calling him shifty without providing any rational argument or evidence.
Example: ""Albanese is being shifty.""

3. Guilt by Association: The tweet implies that Albanese will lead Australia into financial ruin by suggesting that he is in alliance with the Aboriginal elite who are seeking reparations and a percentage of GDP.
Example: ""The Aboriginal elite are after a treaty, and then a percentage of GDP, rates, land tax, water rights, and royalties. On top of the $40 billion a year we already give that is unaccounted for.""

4. False Equivalence: The tweet falsely equates the actions of the Labor government with the actions of conservative politicians, suggesting a double standard in dealing with corruption.
Example: ""The corrupt Dan Andrews Labor Trash Govt stole over $387,000 & it‚Äôs business as usual. Conservative Politicians get busted for receiving a bottle of wine as a gift, the shit hits the fan and they have to step down.""

5. Red Herring: The tweet distracts from the main issue of a global pandemic treaty by bringing up concerns about national sovereignty without providing evidence or logical reasoning.
Example: ""The Global Pandemic Treaty is a danger to our national sovereignty.""

6. Appeal to Fear: The tweet tries to create fear and anxiety by suggesting that supporting the Voice or Treaty will lead to increased taxes and negative consequences for future generations.
Example: ""A voice is a tax on the family home. A tax on farmers. A tax on miners. A tax on small business. A tax on the kids, a tax on our grandchildren. Reparations Treaty tax. An Albanese tax.""

7. Ad Hominem - Circumstantial: The tweet attacks Joe Biden by suggesting that he has contradicted himself regarding Taiwan independence, without providing any substantive evidence or rationale.

The posts also include hashtags for the event such as #KSIFournier, #KSI, #Misfits007, and #DejiSwarmz.","The following fallacies can be identified in the given posts:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or everyone is doing it, then it must be right. In this case, the repeated promotion of multiple live stream links for various events implies that they are important or worth watching because everyone else is watching them too.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy uses emotions rather than logic to persuade or manipulate others. The use of phrases like ""exciting live stream"" and ""don't miss out"" in the posts aims to evoke excitement and capture people's emotions rather than provide any logical reasoning for watching the streams.

3. Red Herring: A red herring fallacy is a distraction from the main issue or topic. In this case, the continuous posting of live stream links for different events diverts attention from the original purpose of the posts, which could be to discuss or inform about the events themselves.

Example:

United States,Russia,Nationalistic goal.,To promote and support the Arkansas Razorbacks football team.,Pro-Arkansas sports and recruitment campaign.,April,"- College sports (specifically Arkansas Razorbacks)
- Team loyalty and support (#WPS - Woo Pig Sooie)
- Recruiting and transfers in college football
- US-China relations and potential threats from China
- Military and patriotic themes (related to US veterans)
- Region-specific pride and comparisons (Fayetteville vs Tuscaloosa)","1. Appeal to Authority - This fallacy exists in the post by @GMastersonCPA. The post claims that China is a threat in many ways, but the information provided is not supported by any credible sources. By claiming that China owns the Biden Crime Family and a significant amount of US farmland without providing evidence, this post is appealing to authority without providing reliable sources.

Example: ""China is a threat in many ways. They own the Biden Crime Family. They own 384,000 acres of US farmland (Bill Gates only owns 269,000), some in proximity to military bases, yet China prohibits us from owning any land.""

2. Genetic - This fallacy exists in the post by @OtisKirk23. The post discusses Arkansas being in the mix for an LSU commitment and a former TCU CB, sponsored by Dr. Pepper, implying that these players should be considered for recruitment solely based on their previous association with these schools. This fallacy assumes that because a player previously played for a certain school, they would be a good fit for Arkansas, without considering other relevant factors.

Example: ""#Arkansas #Razorbacks in mix for #LSU commitment, Sponsored by @drpepper (FREE) #Hogs #WPS. #Arkansas #Razorbacks land former #TCU CB, Sponsored by @drpepper (FREE) #Hogs #WPS.""

3. Appeal to the People - This fallacy exists in the post by @HawgsByNinety. The post compares the experience of living in Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, claiming that Fayetteville absolutely ""slaughters"" Birmingham. While personal preference plays a role in this statement, using the opinion of one person to make a general claim about Fayetteville being superior appeals to the people who would agree with this sentiment without providing any objective evidence or reasoning.

Example: ""Raised in Arkansas and been in Birmingham 10 years. I've been to Tuscaloosa countless times. Fayetteville absolutely slaughters it.

1. Bullrun starting from China
2. Focus on investing in #OGGYINU
3. Secure your future before the bullrun starts
4. Encouraging the purchase of #OGGY token","The following fallacies can be found in the provided posts:

1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in the posts as they reference ""#CZ"" as an authority figure whose opinion should be followed on the topic of a bull run starting in China and the focus on #OGGYINU. This fallacy assumes that because #CZ is mentioned, their opinion should be taken as truth.

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy is present in the posts as they urge others to buy #OGGY and secure their future before the bull run starts. By suggesting that others should follow suit because many others are doing so, it implies that the popularity of #OGGY is a reason to invest, which is not a logically sound argument.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be seen in the posts as they use language like ""Don't be a fool"" and ""secure your future"" to evoke emotional responses from readers. By appealing to fear of missing out or fear of not securing one's future, the posts attempt to influence decisions based on emotions rather than rationality.

1. Bullrun starting from China
2. Focusing on #pepainu
3. Encouraging people to buy #pepa to secure their future before the bullrun starts.","The fallacies present in the posts are:

- Appeal to Authority: The posts appeal to the authority of #CZ (presumably referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) to suggest that a bullrun will start in China and promote the purchase of #pepa cryptocurrency.
- Bandwagon: The posts attempt to create a sense of urgency and encourage individuals to join the trend of buying #pepa before the supposed bullrun starts.

For example, despite the initial tweet about the bull run starting from China and the focus on #pepainu, the distract tactic is used by bringing up unrelated topics in subsequent tweets, such as launching a new utility based on AI, marketing a social platform, AI bots, influencers support, Chinese marketing, marketing a new project, killing one zero, etc.

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy may exist in the post that includes the name ""Marcos"" because it could be attacking or discrediting the person associated with that name.

Example: ""@knj_brasil @secawards Marcos I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards""

3. Hasty Generalization: This fallacy may exist in the post that simply says ""1899"" as it is making a quick judgment based on limited information without considering all the factors.

Example: ""@Haxley17 1899 I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards""

4. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy may exist in the post that says ""2023 #SECAwards"" as it is appealing to the tradition or past practice of voting in the same event.

Example: ""@knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the 2023 #SECAwards Marcos""","- Cultural cues or in-group language: @knj_brasil, @demonarmys, @secawards, #RM, #ArtistaAsiatico, Marcos

United States,United States,Recruitment of players for football team,Recruitment for college football team.,Football team National Signing Day posts to promote new recruits.,February,"The major themes from these posts are National Signing Day for college football recruits, welcoming new players to a team, and the use of hashtags to promote the event and team.","Some potential fallacies that exist in the provided posts are Bandwagon, Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Ignorance, Confirmation Bias, Appeal to Emotions, Ad Hominem, Appeal to Past Practice, and Group Think.

1. Bandwagon: The posts encourage excitement and anticipation about the upcoming National Signing Day and the new additions to the team, creating a bandwagon effect to join in the enthusiasm.

2. Appeal to Authority: By using the official SVSU Football account to announce the signings and tagging the high schools of the players, the posts appeal to the authority of the team and the schools.

3. Appeal to Ignorance: The posts make statements like ""Can't wait to announce our newest additions,"" appealing to the ignorance of the audience about the specific players being signed.

4. Confirmation Bias: By only focusing on positive aspects like ""Welcome"" and ""Signed"" for each player announcement, the posts exhibit confirmation bias by ignoring any potential negative aspects or criticisms.

5. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotive language like ""Welcome,"" ""Excited to announce,"" and ""Can't wait,"" appealing to the emotions of the audience.

6. Ad Hominem: While not overtly seen in the posts, ad hominem attacks on opposing teams or players could be implied.

7. Appeal to Past Practice: References to past signings and using the hashtag ""NSD23"" suggest an appeal to past practice and tradition, indicating the importance of National Signing Day.

8. Group Think: The posts create a sense of unity and belonging among followers of the SVSU Football team by using hashtags like ""Swarm23ason"" and ""EarnIT,"" promoting a sense of group think and conformity within the fanbase.
