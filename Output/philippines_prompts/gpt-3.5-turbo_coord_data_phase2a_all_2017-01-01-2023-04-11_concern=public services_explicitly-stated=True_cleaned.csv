- Positive reviews and reactions from audiences who have watched the movie
- Milestones and achievements of ""Pathaan,"" such as crossing 1000 crores worldwide and becoming India's highest opener
- Celebrating the success of ""Pathaan"" and its impact on fans and audiences","The following fallacies can be identified in the tweets:

1. Appeal to Authority: The tweets are promoting the movie ""Pathaan"" by using the authority or endorsement of YRF (Yash Raj Films), Shah Rukh Khan, and SRKUniverse to persuade people to book tickets and watch the movie.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets evoke emotions such as excitement, celebration, love, and appreciation to attract the audience's attention and persuade them to watch the movie.
   Example: ""Witness the rollercoaster ride of action and entertainment as it roars across theatres! #Pathaan Book your tickets - https://t.co/SD17p6x9HI | https://t.co/VkhFng6vBj Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you, in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.""

3. Appeal to Popularity: The tweets emphasize the success and popularity of the movie ""Pathaan"" by highlighting factors such as audience reactions, box office collections, and historic achievements to sway the audience to watch the movie.

The tweets also include links to join VIP groups and websites for accessing adult content.","The fallacies present in these posts are Appeal to Emotions, Straw Man, and Red Herring.

1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts are appealing to the audience's emotions by using explicit and provocative language to incite arousal or shock. This fallacy is evident in the use of explicit terms and descriptions in order to attract attention.

2. Straw Man: The posts set up a distorted version of an argument or position that is easier to attack, rather than accurately representing the actual argument. In this case, the posts create a straw man by focusing on explicit content instead of discussing the actual topic of public services.

3. Red Herring: The posts contain irrelevant or distracting information that is meant to divert attention away from the main topic of public services. By focusing on explicit content, the posts introduce a red herring that takes the focus away from the intended discussion.

China,China.,Discrediting China and the Chinese Communist Party.,Discrediting China and CCP-led initiatives.,"Information operation seeking to inflame tensions between China and the U.S. and its allies, promote anti-CCP sentiment, and support the New Federal State of China.",This information operation likely started in March.,"Themes from the posts include:
1. Concerns about China's potential military support to Russia
2. Economic and diplomatic relationships with China
3. Criticism of the Chinese Communist Party
4. Allegations of Chinese weapons supply to Russia
5. Reports of intimidation and harassment by the Chinese Communist Party
6. Surveillance and control by the Chinese government
7. Criticism of the CCP's handling of information and events
8. International relations and cooperation
9. Allegations of cooperation with the Chinese military

(Note: These themes are based on the content of the tweets and may not fully capture the nuances of the original posts.)","The following intentional fallacies can be identified in the posts:

1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when the argument is based on manipulating emotions rather than using logical reasoning. For example, ""The Childish Chinese Communist Party Intimidates Taiwan Yet Again"" plays on emotions to evoke a negative reaction towards the Chinese Communist Party without presenting sound reasoning.

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy involves attacking the character or traits of an individual rather than addressing the argument itself. For instance, ""the Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out intimidation, harassment, and media-warfare campaigns against #MilesGuo, a vocal critic of their brutal, authoritarian regime and founder of the New Federal State of China movement"" showcases a personal attack on the Chinese Communist Party rather than providing valid arguments.

3. Sweeping Generalization: This fallacy involves making broad generalizations based on limited or insufficient evidence. For example, ""America's justice system has been weaponized by the Chinese Communist Party!"" makes a sweeping generalization about the entire justice system without providing specific evidence to support the claim.

It's important to note that these fallacies undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the arguments presented in the posts.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts imply a strong anti-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sentiment and support for the New Federal State of China (NFSC) movement. The posts mention the CCP engaging in intimidation, harassment, and media-warfare campaigns, sending weapons and military supplies to Russia, and false claims regarding deaths in China. They also advocate for decoupling from the CCP economically and establishing a normal diplomatic and economic relationship with the Chinese people represented by the NFSC. The posts refer to Miles Guo as a freedom fighter and criticize the CCP's actions in various contexts.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts are those who are critical of the CCP's authoritarian regime, support the NFSC movement, and advocate for transparency, freedom, and democracy in China. They likely have a strong sense of nationalism and are concerned about the CCP's influence on international affairs.","1. Military support

1. Bandwagon - This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or everyone is doing it, it must be right. In this case, the repeated posting of a book about zombies and horror may be an attempt to create a bandwagon effect, encouraging more people to read the book.

Example post: ""NOW AVAILABLE! #FREE #KindleUnlimited With a new threat rising out of the swarms, Mace knows it will take every ounce of strength and courage they can muster to escape the city of the dead. üëâhttps://t.co/VsfHy9sXja #horror #zombies #mustread #amreading #suspense #thriller""

2. Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy occurs when someone uses emotions, such as fear or sympathy, to persuade others. In this case, the repeated use of fear-inducing language about a new threat rising out of swarms and the need for courage to escape the city of the dead appeals to the emotions of the readers.

Example post: ""NOW AVAILABLE! #FREE #KindleUnlimited With a new threat rising out of the swarms, Mace knows it will take every ounce of strength and courage they can muster to escape the city of the dead. üëâhttps://t.co/VsfHy9sXja #horror #zombies #mustread #amreading #suspense #thriller""

3. Appeal to Tradition - This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is right or good because it has always been done that way. In this case, the repeated posting of the same book and hashtags may be an attempt to appeal to the tradition or familiarity of the content.

Example post: ""NOW AVAILABLE! #FREE #KindleUnlimited With a new threat rising out of the swarms, Mace knows it will take every ounce of strength and courage they can muster to escape the city of the dead. üëâhttps://t.co/VsfHy9sXja #horror #zombies #mustread #amreading #suspense #thriller""","1.

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists in the tweet from BamaStateSports congratulating a coach on a great year. The appeal to authority fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade by using an authority figure to back up their argument, rather than providing logical reasoning. Example: ""Congrats to Coach Andrew Chatmon & @BamaStateBowl on a great year! Great things ahead for Lady Hornet Bowling!""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the tweet from BamaStateWBB celebrating Ayana Emmanuel reaching the 2000 point club. The appeal to emotions fallacy occurs when someone uses emotional language or anecdotes to sway an audience instead of providing logical arguments. Example: ""WELCOME TO THE 2000 POINT CLUB! Ayana Emmanuel has 27 points today to put her at 2K career points at Alabama State!""

3. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in the tweet from Tashaa125 celebrating a win with emojis. The bandwagon fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or widely accepted, it must be true or good. Example: ""Whoot! üßπüêù‚öæÔ∏è #RYSASU #Swarm""

4. False Cause: This fallacy could be present in the tweet from BamaStateBB about adding two more runs.

5. Hasty Generalization: This fallacy could be present in the tweet about the Women's 4x400m relay team earning 2nd place.

Armenia,Azerbaijan,The type of political goal for the posts is anti-Azerbaijan propaganda.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to portray Azerbaijan's President Aliyev as a dictator who is committing war crimes and inciting humanitarian crises.,"Information operation: Anti-Azerbaijan, Pro-Armenia, focusing on criticizing Aliyev and advocating for sanctions and #StopArtsakhBlockade.",March,"- Humanitarian crisis
- Violation of human rights
- Blockade of Artsakh
- War crimes
- Sanctions against Aliyev
- Ethnic cleansing
- Ceasefire violations
- International court cases against dictators
- Censorship and lack of free press
- Anti-Armenophobia and propaganda efforts
- Need for intervention and peacekeepers
- Lack of action by Western leaders.","Ambiguity - The tweets use ambiguous language and emotional appeals to make their points and call for action against Aliyev. For example, phrases like ""war of petrodollars"" and ""to eradicate the Armenian people"" can be interpreted in various ways, leading to ambiguity.

Example post: ""Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev threatens to eradicate the Armenian people. It's the war of petrodollars and barbarism against democracy. For Human Rights to be victorious: #SanctionAliyev""

Appeal to Emotions - The tweets use emotional language and imagery to evoke strong feelings of anger and sympathy towards the situation in Artsakh. This appeal to emotions can cloud judgment and lead to actions based on feelings rather than reasoning.

Example post: ""A mother whose child is sick and who does not receive help from the state rightfully says harsh things to #Aliyev. 'Aliyev is a coward, he doesn't hear these things...' This is #Azerbaijan #stopAliyev""

Appeal to Authority - The tweets call for action by world leaders and international organizations to sanction Aliyev and intervene in the situation in Artsakh. This appeal to authority assumes that these figures have the power and ability to address the issue effectively.

Example post: ""Will you leave 120000 people starving in Artsakh because of Aliyev's inhuman blockade? #StopArtsakhBlockade #RecognizeArtsakh #UNPeacekeepersForArtsakh""

2. References to Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev and calls for sanctions against him suggest a strong anti-Azerbaijan sentiment within the Armenian community.
3. Mention of specific political leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen, as well as international bodies like the UN, indicates a desire for external support and intervention in the conflict.
4. Criticisms of Aliyev and references to his actions as terrorism and ethnic cleansing highlight the deep-seated animosity towards the Azerbaijani government.
5. Mention of specific incidents such as ceasefire violations and territorial advancements by Azerbaijan demonstrate a close monitoring of the ongoing conflict.
6. References to media bias and propaganda from Baku suggest a belief in the importance of countering Azerbaijani narratives.

Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy exists in the tweet by GreenpeaceNZ as it states ""UN Ocean Treaty talks in jeopardy - global north must show flexibility"" to evoke feelings of concern and urgency in the audience.

Example: ""UN Ocean Treaty talks in jeopardy - global north must show flexibility in order to save our oceans and marine life!""

2. Appeal to Vanity - This fallacy exists in the tweet by GreenpeaceSEA as it appeals to the audience's sense of accomplishment and pride by stating ""If politicians get this right it would safeguard marine life and be the biggest conservation victory for a generation.""

Example: ""As advocates for the environment, signing the petition for the Global Ocean Treaty will be your chance to be part of the biggest conservation victory of our generation!""

3. Appeal to Traditional Wisdom - This fallacy exists in the tweet by ocean_twin as it mentions ""finally a UN high seas treaty"" implying that the UN's decisions are based on wisdom passed down through generations and should be respected.

Example: ""With the new UN high seas treaty, we are finally seeing the wisdom of our ancestors come to fruition in protecting our oceans for future generations.""

4. Appeal to Money - This fallacy exists in the tweet by Wes_Andrews as it implies that China's power can be measured by its assets in US dollars, linking financial wealth to global influence.

Example: ""Even CPC insiders trust in the power of the US dollar over the Chinese yuan - show me the money, and I'll show you the true superpower!""

5. Argument from Outrage - This fallacy exists in the tweet by DavidNeiwert as it uses the example of Trump and his supporters chanting ""Lock her/him up"" at various politicians to incite outrage and draw attention to the perceived hypocrisy of the Republican party.

Example: ""From Clinton to Biden, why are Republicans quick to condemn other politicians for authoritarian acts they themselves support? The hypocrisy is glaring and outrageous!""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts are related to environmental activism and advocacy for global treaties to address environmental issues such as plastic pollution and protecting the oceans. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely made up of individuals who are passionate about environmental conservation, sustainability, and advocating for policies to protect the planet. The use of hashtags such as #PlasticPollution, #PlasticsTreaty, and #ProtectTheOceans, as well as mentioning organizations like Greenpeace, AzulDotOrg, and Mission Blue, indicates a shared interest in environmental issues and a desire for international cooperation and action.

Brazil,Brazil,Influence public opinion.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to manipulate the outcomes of the SECAwards by encouraging voting for a specific candidate (RM) with the use of multiple fake accounts and retweets.,"Coordinated social media campaign to promote RM for Artista Asiatico at SECAwards, using multiple accounts and repetitive messages.",Starting month: October,"The major themes from the provided posts include voting for a specific candidate (#RM) for a specific award (#ArtistaAsiatico) at the #SECAwards, with mentions of Marcos and the year 2023. Additionally, there is a focus on public services in some of the tweets.","1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in the first post because the user is trying to influence others by mentioning other accounts in order to make their argument seem more credible.

Example: @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy is present in most of the posts where the user tries to influence others to vote for #RM by mentioning other accounts who have already voted. This creates a sense of ""jumping on the bandwagon"" and following the crowd.

Example: @knj_brasil @secawards marcos I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards + RT

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in some of the posts where the user tries to evoke feelings of loyalty or support towards #RM in order to influence others to vote for them.

Example: @knj_brasil @secawards marcos I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards + RT

4. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy is present in some of the posts where the user tries to convince others to vote for #RM because it seems like a popular choice or because others are already doing so.

Example: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

Overall, the presence of these fallacies in the tweets suggests that the users are trying to manipulate or persuade others to vote for #RM based on factors other than logical reasoning.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in the posts are related to the K-pop fandom culture. The hashtags like #RM (referring to BTS member Kim Namjoon), #ArtistaAsiatico (meaning Asian artist), and #SECAwards indicate that the posts are part of a voting campaign within the K-pop fandom to nominate a specific artist for an award.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is the K-pop fandom, specifically fans of BTS and Kim Namjoon. The use of Twitter usernames like @knj_brasil, @demonarmys, @KOOKSCHXSE, @kiminjoonies, @JJK_lirio, and @Haxley17 suggest that these users are dedicated fans of BTS, known as ARMYs. The repetition of the hashtag #RM and specific phrases like ""I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards"" further indicate the close-knit community of BTS fans participating in the voting campaign.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts include:

1. @Haxley17 1899 I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards

2. Welcoming new players to the team
3. Highlighting the position and high school of each recruit
4. Using hashtags such as #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnITüéØ
5. Emphasizing excitement and anticipation for the new additions to the team.","Based on the list of fallacies provided, here are some examples of how they could apply to the posts above:

1. Bandwagon: The repeated use of the phrase ""Welcome"" and the celebration of signing new players could be seen as an attempt to create a bandwagon effect to attract more attention and support.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The use of exclamation points, emojis, and phrases like ""Can‚Äôt wait to announce our newest additions to the cardinal family"" are designed to evoke emotional responses rather than provide factual information about the signings.

3. Appeal to Tradition: The use of hashtags like #Swarm23ason and #EarnIT could be an attempt to appeal to tradition and loyalty to the team.

4. Ad Populum: The emphasis on the excitement surrounding National Signing Day and the anticipation of the new additions could be seen as an appeal to popular sentiment rather than focusing on the actual players being signed.

5. Hasty Generalization: Making assumptions about the success and impact of the signed players based on limited information provided in the posts could lead to hasty generalizations about their potential contributions to the team.

Overall, these posts appear to rely heavily on emotional appeals, social validation, and tradition to generate excitement and support for the football team, rather than providing objective and informative content about the signings themselves.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts include hashtags such as #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnITüéØ.

- South Asian countries balancing between China and India
- Discussions among China's elite about restructuring in the post-COVID era
- Concerns about India's actions potentially allowing China to build more structures on rivers","1. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets include emotional language such as ""Colonial slavery"" and ""slave."" This fallacy exists because it attempts to evoke a strong emotional response rather than providing logical reasoning.
   Example: ""Renaming Rajpath to Carpath doesnt get rid of 'Colonial slavery'. Colonial slavery is allowing a foreigner to still dictate your policies & inspecting your facilities like a King.. get that through your head @NarendraModi.. A govt of colonial slaves.""

2. Appeal to Authority: The tweets reference experts and analysts to support their arguments. This fallacy exists because it relies on the authority of the individuals rather than the strength of their arguments.
   Example: ""The 20th Chinese Military Commission, comprising #XiJinping and his loyalists, will have far-reaching implications for #China and the world, says @amritajash.""

3. Guilt by Association: The tweets associate China with negative actions such as genocide and military aggression. This fallacy exists because it links China to unrelated negative events to influence perceptions.
   Example: ""Democratic regimes must continue to impose #sanctions and show more sincerity in scrutinising, exposing, and punishing #China‚Äôs genocide of its #Muslim minorities, asserts @wani_ayjaz.""

4. Red Herring: The tweets divert attention from the main topic by introducing unrelated issues such as colonialism and the restructuring of Chinese institutions. This fallacy exists because it introduces distractions to avoid addressing the main argument.
