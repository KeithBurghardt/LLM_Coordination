Australia,Australia,Discrediting opponents in international relations.,"1. Discrediting the Australian government, particularly climate minister Lily D'Ambrosio, and the media misinformation surrounding climate change.
2. Expressing anti-China sentiment and distrust in global interconnectedness, promoting nationalism.
3. Highlighting issues around Indigenous rights in Australia and the failure of government policies to address them effectively.
4. Pushing anti-establishment sentiments and conspiracy theories related to the World Health Organization and global government overreach.
5. Criticizing political figures in the United States and highlighting perceived failures in justice and politics.
6. Denying climate change by promoting the health of the Great Barrier Reef.

    Explanation: This fallacy is present in the tweet as it assumes that just because someone is perceived as honest, the allegations against them must be false. It relies on the traditional perception of the individual rather than addressing the specific issue at hand.

2. Ad Hominem
    Example: ""Hi @AnnastaciaMP üëã If Brisbane was a union worksite & people were dying, your reaction would be different. Crisis after crisis after crisis. Are you the unluckiest politician ever? Or are you a terrible person & terrible at your job? Resign #dud #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""

    Example: ""RT @DavidMusiker The Democrats family's are swarming into NY to celebrate Trump being booked. These actions represent Vendettas at a huge cost to Americas Justice. Should it now be open season on Obama, Clinton & the Biden crime family in Republican run States?""

2. Political corruption in relation to government officials and their actions.
3. Economic relationships between countries like China, Russia, and the United States.
4. Geopolitical tensions and potential authoritarian treaties.
5. Indigenous rights and the issues faced by indigenous communities.
6. Calls for political leaders to resign due to corruption and inefficiency.
7. Concerns about potential distractions from important global issues.
8. Advocacy for transparency, accountability, and action in response to global challenges.
9. Expressions of disappointment and concern over the state of political affairs in countries like the United States and Australia.
10. Criticism of political actions and decisions that may impact international relations.","Problem:
1. @Kanthan2030 - China is the world‚Äôs #1 manufacturer of cars and the #2 exporter of cars. And China‚Äôs #1 customer is‚Ä¶ Putin! I mean, Russia. The U.S. and its non-sovereign puppet continent known as Europe must understand that the world has become more self-sufficient and resilient.
2. @amnesty11 - All vestiges of ‚Äòcolonial laws‚Äô implemented over past 200 years must be wiped out. Dan Andrews went to China to recruit a team of cccp advocates to advise the VOICE PEOPLE how to run the COUNTRY under the silk road statutes.
3. @NWGLP - China National Intelligence Law ""all Chinese citizens and companies under a legal obligation to SPY"" ""gather intelligence (& keep any cooperation secret) allows CCP to embed people, devices, facilities in any premise anywhere to SPY"".
4. @RepTroyNehls - 65 Democrats just voted against a committee to investigate China. Are you paying attention yet?

Solution:
1. @fnq_the - Do not believe what you are being told. Great Barrier Reef is very healthy and growing. Notice a sand cay in the background. Amazing, 1.5 hours out and walking on a sand hump. Colors never come out on a pic! Water approx 27o If you've never been..you should #LoveWhereYouLive.
2. @QBCCIntegrity - ‚ÄúTPV holders will be offered new Resolution visas that will come with social security rights, higher education support, and access to the NDIS, along with ongoing Medicare cover and mental health support‚Äù as @AlboMP throws boarders open and boats swarm.
3. @Seagullrm - #AirbusAlbo & Labor want an indigenous Voice to Parliament. Lydia Thorpe & urban activists want a treaty. The messaging coming from indigenous communities across Northern Australia is not about a Voice or treaty. They just want some hope. I think this is a good place to start.
4. @lane_byron - Give Aborigines power to make treaties. Set up companies and a bureaucratic strata to supply and service them. Politicians then buy shares in those companies; treaty contracts bring in millions in 'dividends' not to mention payoffs to pollies. US/Native Indian system.

Remedy:
1. @Xx17965797N - The WHO is trying to sneak this global authoritarian treaty through, while people are distracted. The first meeting is on March 1st. Dr. Astrid Stuckelberger, ex WHO member, has been trying to alert the world.
2. @KSCUBKEE - A distraction from the pandemic treaty and if governments look ineffective and inefficient (not difficult) the next step is to call for a one-world government in different arenas like health and finance.
3. @KimDotcom - The United States of America have officially achieved the status of Banana Republic. Welcome to the club of political targets Donald. You should remember Julian Assange today. Julian helped you by releasing the truth about your corrupt accusers and you failed to pardon him.
4. @DavidMusiker - The Democrats family's are swarming into NY to celebrate Trump being booked. These actions represent Vendettas at a huge cost to Americans Justice. Should it now be open season on Obama, Clinton & the Biden crime family in Republican run States?",

Example: ""Canadian father's of all daughters out there. How could you possibly vote for The CPC after that shameful display in HOC by them during a portion of Biden's speech on gender diversity?""

2. Appeal to Emotions: The fallacy of attempting to manipulate emotions in order to win an argument. Example: ""What does it say about the CPC when they block a motion to expand the scope of investigating election interference to include Russia?""

3. Appeal to Force: The fallacy of attempting to win an argument through threat or force. Example: ""Anyone that supports the NDP needs to seriously reconsider if @theJagmeetSingh stays on as leader. He's willing to put a CPC government in place, knowing the damage it would do, if it makes him look better.""

4. False Cause: The fallacy of assuming that because one event follows another, the first event caused the second. Example: ""In QP, Government House Leader Mark Holland says the Privy Council offered CPC Leader Pierre Poilievre a briefing on electoral interference and he declined it.""

5. Loaded Language: The fallacy of using emotionally-charged or biased language to manipulate the audience. Example: ""CPC MPs have been faithfully serving and supporting elites/gatekeepers since 2003.""

6. Straw Man: The fallacy of misrepresenting an opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack. Example: ""What a lame 1 year anniversary of the freedom convoy when you think about it. No MOU, no CPC support, no foreign funding. Pretty weak if you ask me.""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they involve logical errors in reasoning and attempt to manipulate emotions, attack individuals, or present misleading information to support a particular point of view on the topic of international relations.","- The hashtag #CPC refers to the Conservative Party of Canada, implying a culture of Canadian politics.
- Referring to Joe Biden implies a connection to American politics.
- Mention of Pierre Poilievre, Mark Holland, and Jagmeet Singh are all Canadian politicians, indicating a focus on Canadian political figures.
- References to the Privy Council, HOC (House of Commons), and QP (Question Period) further emphasize a focus on Canadian government and politics.
- Mention of electoral interference, Russia, and Chinese government interference suggest a focus on international relations and foreign policy in a Canadian context.
- The use of emojis, hashtags, and slang such as ""PeePee"" for Pierre Poilievre and ""BBM me"" for BlackBerry Messenger imply a younger, more social media-savvy audience or culture.
- References to legal loopholes, treaty rights violations, and environmental issues suggest a concern for justice, legal matters, and environmental activism.

1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotionally charged language such as ""The Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out intimidation, harassment, and media-warfare campaigns"" and ""Steve Bannon interview with citizens of the NFSC: The CCP is criminal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" to invoke fear and anger in the readers.
Example: ""The Chinese Communist Party has been sending massive amounts of weapons and military supplies to Russia even before the start of the Russo-Ukraine War!""

2. Association Fallacy: The posts associate various negative actions with the Chinese Communist Party without providing concrete evidence.
Example: ""The CCP are running secret police forces in Athens. Those who hold different political views from the CCP are intimidated, kidnapped, and forcibly transferred back to mainland China.""

3. Appeal to Authority: The posts rely on authority figures such as Steve Bannon and Neil Shen to make their arguments without providing substantial evidence to support their claims.
Example: ""Neil Shen of Sequoia Capital is the proxy of several factions of the CCP. His success in the U.S. is only possible with the support of political, intelligence and military from Communist China.""

5. ""Cultural sovereignty"" - highlights the importance of preserving cultural identity in the face of CCP's attempts to control and homogenize populations.

6. ""New Federal State of China"" - symbolizes a movement for democracy and freedom as an alternative to CCP's authoritarian regime.

7. ""CCP Virus"" - implicates the origin and purpose of the COVID-19 pandemic, attributing it to the CCP's intentions to harm others.

Post: ""The ISW says that only a series of Ukrainian victories may persuade Putin to negotiate on terms other than the achievement of his territorial ambitions in Ukraine. 'There is reason to expect that Ukrainian forces can, in fact, make gains through counteroffensives,' the ISW said.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
Explanation: The post appeals to the authority of the ISW (Institute for the Study of War) to support its argument. However, just because an authority says something does not necessarily make it true or valid.

2. Post: ""‚ö°Ô∏èISW: Russia forced to choose between skilled defense workers and military personnel. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin announced a new strategy to mobilize the 'struggling Russian defense industrial base (DIB) for a protracted war effort' through deferral of military service.""

Fallacy: Loaded Language
Explanation: The post uses the term ""Russian dictator"" to describe Putin, which is a loaded term meant to evoke negative emotions and bias the reader's perception. This detracts from the objective discussion of the topic.

3. Post: ""The American Brooklyn class Cruiser USS Phoenix had enjoyed a charmed life, having escaped from Pearl Harbor and even having been General MacArthur's flagship. On April 9th 1951 she was sold to Argentina and eventually renamed the ARA General Belgrano.""

Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
Explanation: The post makes a statement about the USS Phoenix having a charmed life based on specific events and then draws a conclusion about its overall history. This is a hasty generalization as it extrapolates too broadly from limited evidence.

4. Post: ""MRT @tim_fargo No science is immune 2 the infection of politics & the corruption of power. - Jacob Bronowski #quote""

Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
Explanation: The post uses a quote from Jacob Bronowski to support its argument about the corruption of science by politics and power.

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,The political goal for these posts is to advocate for sanctions against the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan in response to alleged human rights violations targeting the Armenian population in Artsakh and Armenia.,The political goal of the information operation is to urge world leaders to enact sanctions against the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan due to alleged aggression and human rights violations against the Armenian population in Artsakh and Armenia.,This is an information operation promoting the narrative of anti-Aliyev sentiment and advocating for sanctions against Azerbaijan due to alleged aggression towards the Armenian people.,March,"The major themes from the posts are the escalating aggressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people in Artsakh & Armenia, calls for sanctions against Aliyev, concerns about democracy and ethnic cleansing, and the involvement of international actors in the situation.","1. Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy exists in the posts that use emotionally charged language and imagery to evoke a strong emotional response from the reader. For example, the post that reads ""Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev threatens to eradicate the Armenian people"" is a clear appeal to emotions by painting a dramatic and frightening picture.

2. Ad Hominem - This fallacy exists in posts that attack the character or motives of the Azerbaijani government and its leader Aliyev, rather than addressing the arguments or issues at hand. For example, calling Aliyev a dictator without providing evidence or reasoning is an ad hominem attack.

3. Bandwagon - This fallacy exists in posts that encourage others to join a cause or action simply because it is popular or seems to have widespread support. For example, using hashtags like #SanctionAliyev repeatedly throughout the posts can be seen as a bandwagon fallacy, appealing to the masses to support the idea without providing substantial evidence or reasoning.

4. Sweeping Generalization - This fallacy exists in posts that make overly broad or sweeping statements about the Azerbaijani government and its actions without providing specific evidence or nuance. For example, referring to the actions of the ""Aliyev regime"" as ""democracy and ethnic cleaning are at stake"" without specifying or providing context is a sweeping generalization.

5. False Analogy - This fallacy exists in posts that draw comparisons between unrelated situations or events to make a point. For example, comparing the situation in Azerbaijan to a ""war of petrodollars and barbarism against democracy"" is a false analogy as it oversimplifies complex geopolitical issues.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a pro-Armenian and anti-Azerbaijani sentiment. The repeated use of hashtags like #SanctionAliyev and #StopArtsakhBlockade, along with references to Aliyev as a dictator and threats of eradicating Armenian people, suggest a strong affiliation with the Armenian culture and community. The posts also mention specific political figures such as Emmanuel Macron, Josep Borrell, and the US President and Secretary of State, indicating a belief that these individuals should take action against the Aliyev regime. Overall, the culture implied by these posts is one that supports the Armenian people and condemns the actions of the Azerbaijani government.","- Agressions

2.

This post provides evidence by sharing a link to ancient artifacts unearthed by archaeologists associated with Aliyev, giving more context to the conversation. This falls under the Explain tactic as it provides additional details on the topic at hand.","The posts that use an Excite tactic to elicit positive emotion are the ones that emphasize the need for action to stop the aggression and human rights violations by the Aliyev regime. For example, the posts that call for sanctions on Aliyev, highlight the threat to eradicate the Armenian people, and appeal for human rights to be victorious are using emotional language to evoke a sense of urgency and concern. These posts aim to excite or elicit a positive emotion of solidarity, justice, and hope for a better outcome in the situation.","There are several posts using an Enhance tactic to encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic. These posts repeatedly call for action against the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan due to their alleged aggressions and threats against the Armenian people in Artsakh and Armenia. The use of hashtags like #SanctionAliyev and #StopArtsakhBlockade in multiple posts is meant to amplify the message and urge leaders to take action. Additionally, the repetition of the same message in multiple posts from different accounts is a coordinated effort to enhance the visibility of the issue and put pressure on relevant authorities to address it. 

Overall, the coordinated campaign is using an Enhance tactic to amplify the message and garner support for their cause.","The following posts use the Distort tactic:
- Post by @AzerbaijanRuins @ColdFacts2 @bcaron64 sharing ancient artifacts unearthed by Aliyev certified archaeologists. This post tries to alter the main message of the topic by focusing on positive aspects of Aliyev instead of addressing the escalating aggressions and ethnic cleansing.

1. ""Day 36 of sadistic and unlawful #ArtsakhBlockade by the despotic Aliyev regime. No sustainable food and medical supplies for 120000 people trapped in their homes under the siege. #artsakhairlift""
2. ""Day 8Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ of the unlawful, sadistic #ArtsakhBlockade by the genocidal & despotic Aliyev regime, inspired by its decades-long impunity. @CIJ_ICJ legally binding decision paves the way for all able international actors - @UN, @EUCouncil to act & open #LachinCorridor #SanctionAliyev""","The following posts use a distracting tactic by talking about completely different topics that are irrelevant to the main issue of agressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people in Artsakh & Armenia:

2. In a joint Scholz/Aliyev press conference (mostly about AZ gas exports), Scholz said Germany doesn't recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev, despite AZ blockading NK for 3 months and threatening new military attacks, said AZ gave Armenia a ""chance for peace.""

3. The Aliyev regime needs racial enemies. There will be no peace in the Caucasus as long as there is an Aliyev regime.

These posts distract from the main issue of calling for action against the Aliyev regime by discussing topics such as ancient artifacts, gas exports, and racial enemies that are not relevant to the situation in Artsakh & Armenia.

China,China,Disinformation: Promote meme cryptocurrency $pepa for financial gain.,"The political goal of the information operation is to promote the meme coin $pepa as the best option for investment, with a focus on targeting Chinese markets and investors in order to drive up the price of the coin.",Information Operation: Pump and dump scheme for the crypto coin $pepa with false information about China's involvement.,June,"The major themes from the tweets are:
1. Focus on the potential bull run starting from China.
2. Emphasis on the meme coin $pepa as a good investment option.
3. Mention of connections to influential figures and organizations such as CZ (Changpeng Zhao), crypto influencers, Binance, and more.
4. Discussions about AI-based projects and utility launching.
5. Speculation and discussion about market trends, investments, and future outcomes.
6. Use of hashtags to categorize topics and connect with relevant audiences.
7. Mentions of various cryptocurrency projects and their potential growth.","The posts provided contain the fallacy of Appeal to Authority, specifically by mentioning ""CZ"" as the authority figure predicting a bull run starting from China. This fallacy relies on the credibility or authority of the person making the statement rather than on the evidence or logic supporting the claim.

Example of the fallacy in one of the posts:
""Go $pepa the best meme coin üöÄüê∏üê∑üöÄ""

This post attempts to persuade others to buy a certain meme coin based on the suggestion that it is the best, without providing any substantial evidence or logical reasoning.

Another fallacy present in these posts is Bandwagon, where the statement encourages people to join the trend of buying a particular coin without providing valid reasons for doing so. This fallacy assumes that because something is popular or trending, it must be worth doing.

Example of the fallacy in one of the posts:
""Just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bull run starts""

This post implies that buying the mentioned coin will lead to a secure future simply because of the opportunity presented by the upcoming bull run, without providing any substantial information or analysis to support this claim.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts are related to cryptocurrency culture and the specific terminology used within that community. This includes references to specific cryptocurrencies like $pepa, meme coins, and specific influencers and platforms within the cryptocurrency space. 

The in-group implied by these posts is the cryptocurrency community, which is known for using specific terminology, emojis, and references to boost visibility and engagement within their circles. The use of hashtags like #CZ (possibly referring to a cryptocurrency influencer or figure) and the focus on China as a key player in the cryptocurrency market shows the community's attention to global trends and market movements. 

Overall, these posts are intended to appeal to cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders who are familiar with the language, trends, and key figures within the cryptocurrency community.","1. China
2. Chinese
3. SEC
4. Bullrun
5. Focusing
6. Connection
7. Chinese marketing
8. Chinese language motif (e.g. emojis or characters)","None of the posts use an Engage tactic to bring up a related but relevant topic. All the posts are focused on promoting the coin $pepa and discussing the potential bull run starting from China. The content is mainly about cryptocurrency and investment advice, not international relations.",None of the posts in the coordinated campaign use an Explain tactic. They are all promoting a meme coin called $pepa and suggesting that buying it will secure your future before a bull run starts in China.,None of the posts use an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement.,There are no posts using an Enhance tactic in this campaign.,"The Distort tactic is used in the coordinated campaign. The main message is about a meme coin called $pepa being the best and focusing on the Chinese market for a bull run, which is not related to the actual topic of international relations. Instead, the campaign is promoting a specific cryptocurrency using misleading information.","The posts that use a Dismay tactic to elicit negative emotions are those that mention the potential negative impacts of not buying #pepa and securing your future before the bullrun starts. These posts are creating a sense of fear of missing out or potential regret if action is not taken. For example:

- ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""
- ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""
- ""Do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""
- ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future""","The following posts use a distract tactic by discussing an irrelevant topic (meme coins) instead of focusing on international relations, which is the topic being coordinated:

Brazil,Brazil.,Promoting a specific candidate in an international award show.,To manipulate voting at the SECAwards for a particular candidate (RM) named Marcos.,Coordinated social media campaign to vote RM for Artista Asiatico at SECAwards,May,"The major themes from these posts include voting for RM (a member of the K-pop group BTS) for Artista Asiatico at the SECAwards, specifically mentioning Marcos. These posts also show support for international relations through participation in the awards ceremony.","1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true because it is widely believed or accepted. In this case, the repeated use of the hashtag #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards with different variations of the same message suggests an attempt to manipulate perception by making it seem like many people are voting for the same choice, therefore making it more credible. This can be seen in the following post: 
@knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

2. Bandwagon: The bandwagon fallacy is similar to the appeal to popularity, but it specifically appeals to the idea that because something is popular or widely accepted, it must therefore be the correct choice. This can be seen in the following post:
@demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

3. Name Calling: This fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the use of the name ""Marcos"" in multiple posts could potentially be a form of name-calling or attempting to discredit the individual by repeatedly associating them with a particular choice. This can be seen in the following post: 
@JJK_lirio @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos

4. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true or correct because it has been believed or followed for a long time. The use of the hashtag #ArtistaAsiatico at the 2023 #SECAwards could be interpreted as an attempt to leverage tradition or the longevity of the event to influence the voting outcome. This can be seen in the following post:

   Example: ""Signed Welcome, Nick Patterson ! @Patterson9N The Quarterback from @MHSBeMOORE #NSD23 | #Swarm23ason l #EarnITüéØ""

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone claims that something must be true because many people believe it. In this case, the repetition of tweets welcoming signed players could create a bandwagon effect, where people may feel pressured to join because others are doing it.
   Example: ""RT @svsu_football National Signing Day is next Wednesday Feb 1st, Tick tock ‚è∞‚è∞_________‚úçüèΩ Can‚Äôt wait to announce our newest additions to the cardinal family.""

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to manipulate emotions to win an argument. In this case, the use of exclamation marks and emojis could be seen as an attempt to evoke excitement and emotion rather than relying on rational arguments.
   Example: ""RT @svsu_football ùêéùêüùêüùê¢ùêúùê¢ùêöùê•ùê•ùê≤ ùêéùêÖùêÖùêàùêÇùêàùêÄùêã ‚úçüèΩ Signed Welcome, Jamari Thomas ! @jamarit13 The wide receiver from Ann Arbor Huron.""

It is important to note that the listed fallacies may not apply directly to the topic of international relations, but rather to the way the posts are presented and the potential use of persuasive techniques.","Cultural Cues/In-group language:
