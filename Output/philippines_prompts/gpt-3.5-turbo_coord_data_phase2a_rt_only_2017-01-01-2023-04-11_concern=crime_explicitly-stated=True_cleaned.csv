Additionally, there is mention of specific politicians, such as Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson, and a focus on the impact of political negligence and criminal behavior.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotionally charged language to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience, rather than relying on logic or evidence.

Example Post: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in town""

4. Loaded Language: The posts use loaded or biased language to skew the audience's perception of the topic or individuals being discussed. 

Example Post: ""I’m not saying they’re laughing at us, but they’re laughing at us. This is morally corrupt on so many different levels #ToriesOut Rishi Sunak's use of jet for hospital trip defended by No 10""

5. False Cause: The posts attribute certain actions or events to specific causes without providing sufficient evidence or logical connections between them. 

Example Post: ""This can only further galvanise the Russian public's support of Russian efforts in this US proxy war.""","- ""Tories"" (referring to the Conservative Party in the UK)

- RT @RichardBurgon The Tories’ new anti-strike legislation is an appalling attack on nurses, teachers, rail workers and others fighting for fair pay. And it’s an attack on the hard-won right to strike. All MPs who value our key workers and democratic freedoms must oppose this authoritarian move.

United States,Russia,Discrediting law enforcement efforts.,"Political goal: Creating fear and division, promoting a tough-on-crime agenda.",Propaganda promoting fear of crime to push for stricter laws and surveillance measures.,Starting month: August,"The major themes from the following posts are violence, justice, social injustice, and criminal behavior.","Post 1: ""All criminals should be locked up for life, no exceptions. The world would be a safer place if we got rid of all of them.""

Fallacy: All-or-Nothing
Explanation: This post presents a black-and-white perspective on crime, failing to acknowledge any potential nuance or exceptions in the criminal justice system.

Example: ""If we just got rid of all criminals, crime rates would drop to zero overnight. It's the only solution.""

Post 2: ""I heard from a friend of a friend that crime rates are going up in our neighborhood. We need to do something about it before it gets out of control.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Unqualified Authority
Explanation: The post relies on hearsay from an unreliable source instead of providing statistics or concrete evidence to support the claim about crime rates.

Example: ""My neighbor's cousin's friend told me that crime is on the rise in our neighborhood. We should definitely be concerned.""

Post 3: ""If you don't agree that harsher punishments are the only way to deter crime, then you must not care about keeping society safe. It's a no-brainer.""

Fallacy: False Dichotomy
Explanation: The post presents only two extreme options - either agree with harsher punishments or be labeled as someone who doesn't care about safety - without considering any other potential solutions to addressing crime.

Example: ""If you're not on board with our plan for stricter sentencing, then you must want criminals running rampant in our streets.""

Post 4: ""Crime rates may have decreased in recent years, but that doesn't change the fact that crime is still a major issue in our society that needs to be addressed.""

Fallacy: Ignoring Inconvenient Data
Explanation: The post acknowledges a decrease in crime rates but avoids considering this information in a meaningful way to address the overall issue of crime in society.

Example: ""Sure, crime rates have gone down, but that doesn't mean we can ignore the fact that crime is still a serious problem that needs attention.""","1. ""Snitches get stitches #loyalty #streetcode""

This post implies a culture or in-group that values loyalty, particularly in the context of street crime. The use of the phrase ""snitches get stitches"" suggests a mentality that discourages cooperation with law enforcement or authorities, often found in criminal or gang subcultures.

This post references the slogan ""ACAB,"" which stands for ""all cops are bastards."" This language is often used by those critical of law enforcement and advocate for reducing or reallocating funds from police departments.

Post 3 uses the distract tactic by shifting the conversation away from the topic of crime and instead focusing on an unrelated and irrelevant topic, such as the new ice cream flavor.

3. ""That's great that you're passionate about animal rights, but shouldn't we be more concerned about human rights first?""

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,Discredit the opposition's leaders.,Discrediting Azerbaijan's President Aliyev and advocating for international sanctions against him.,Disinformation campaign against Azerbaijani President Aliyev for alleged crimes and human rights violations.,"Shortly after Michel's chat with Aliyev, Azerbaijani forces violated the ceasefire and advanced into Nagorno-Karabakh. It's almost like Aliyev sees the EU's lack of action and objection as a green light for further aggressions. Start Month: October","The major themes present in these posts are:
- Criticism of Aliyev's aggressive actions and violations of ceasefire
- Calls for sanctions against the Aliyev regime for war crimes and human rights violations
- Concern over the lack of action and response from the international community
- The impact of Aliyev's actions on the civilian population
- Criticism of foreign governments and organizations supporting the Aliyev regime
- The portrayal of Aliyev as a dictator and perpetrator of genocide","1. Abusive Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when an argument attacks a person's character rather than their argument. In the post by MaroKochinyan, they describe politicians turning a blind eye to dictators like Aliyev as corrupt and money-hungry. This is an abusive ad hominem attack against those politicians.
Example: ""Corrupt and money-hungry politicians who turn a blind eye to the horrors committed by dictators like Aliyev are no better than the dictators themselves.""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure (e.g. President, CEO) rather than facts or evidence. In the post by Danale, they reference Azerbaijani President Aliyev's statement about India's actions as an unfriendly step, attempting to appeal to his authority.
Example: ""Azerbaijani President Aliyev said that 'We regard India's actions to sell weapons to Armenia as an unfriendly step.'""

3. Straw Man: This fallacy occurs when an argument misrepresents an opponent's position to make it easier to attack. In the post by vicgerami, they accuse those supporting Azerbaijan's regime of being responsible for the starvation and freezing deaths of Armenians. This misrepresentation paints supporters as heartless and unfeeling.
Example: ""Those supporting Azerbaijan's fascist regime are responsible for 120,000 Armenians being starved & frozen to death.""

4. False Cause: This fallacy occurs when a causal connection is assumed without evidence to support it. In several posts, the idea that the lack of sanctions against Aliyev is the reason for further aggressions and war crimes is presented without sufficient evidence.
Example: ""It's almost like Aliyev sees the EU's lack of action and objection as a green light for further aggressions.""

5. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when an argument is supported simply because a large number of people believe it to be true. In multiple posts, there is a call for sanctions against Aliyev and Azerbaijan based on the belief that many people support this action.
Example: ""Sanction Aliyev"" reiterated in various posts.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts are related to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The posts mention figures such as Aliyev, who is the President of Azerbaijan, and reference terms like ""Artsakh"" (the Armenian name for the region), ""Lachin Corridor"" (a strategic road connecting Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh), and mention of acts like reopening the corridor, involving UN peacekeeping forces, and calling for sanctions against the Aliyev regime.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is that of the Armenian community and those who support Armenia in the conflict. These posts criticize Aliyev, accuse the Azerbaijani forces of aggression and war crimes, call for sanctions, and advocate for international intervention in support of Armenia.

- Fallacy: Biased Generalizing
- Explanation: This post makes a blanket statement about all criminals, assuming they all have the same motives and characteristics.
- Example: ""All criminals are terrible people and should never be given a second chance. They're just looking for excuses to commit crimes.""

Post 2: ""You can't trust anyone who has been convicted of a crime, they will always revert back to their criminal ways. We need to keep them away from society for good.""

- Explanation: This post attacks individuals who have been convicted of a crime rather than addressing the issue of crime itself.
- Example: ""Convicted criminals will never change, they are inherently evil and should never be given a chance at redemption.""

Post 3: ""Crime rates are higher in low-income neighborhoods because those people are just lazy and don't want to work hard to earn a living. They should just stop complaining and take responsibility for their actions.""

- Fallacy: Anecdotal Evidence

- Example: ""I know someone who committed a crime and changed their ways, so all criminals should be given the same opportunities for redemption.""","1. ""The streets know what's up. Snitches get stitches #loyalty #streetcode""

This post uses cultural cues related to street culture and the ""code of silence"" that is often associated with criminal activity. The use of phrases like ""the streets know what's up"" and ""snitches get stitches"" implies a culture where loyalty to one's peers is highly valued and reporting criminal activity to authorities is frowned upon.

2. ""Gang Gang ain't gonna let nobody mess with our turf #protectthecity #ganglife""

This post uses in-group language related to gang culture, with phrases like ""Gang Gang"" and ""our turf."" These references indicate that the poster is part of a gang or group that prioritizes protecting their territory through potentially criminal means.

3. ""If you ain't from the block, you don't know the struggle #hoodlife #respectthecode""

This post references life in a ""hood"" or urban neighborhood, and specifies that only those who are from that environment understand the hardships and challenges faced by its residents.

Post 4: ""Crime doesn't just hurt the victims, it affects the whole community. We need to take a stand against crime and work towards creating a safer future for everyone.""

Post 4: ""Have you guys seen the latest episode of that crime TV show? It's so addictive, I can't stop watching #crime"" 

Post 2 uses the Distract tactic by shifting the conversation away from the topic of crime and focusing on the nice weather instead.

Explanation: This tweet attacks the credibility and motives of the police chief rather than engaging with the evidence presented about the crime rate.

Example: ""You can't trust anything the police chief says. He's just trying to make himself look good and hide the real crime statistics from the public.""

4. ""Everyone I know thinks that harsher punishments are the only way to deter crime. Why don't the lawmakers listen to what the people want?""

Fallacy: Appeal to the People
Explanation: This tweet attempts to justify a belief or course of action by appealing to the opinions of the masses rather than considering the actual effectiveness of harsher punishments in deterring crime.

Example: ""If the majority of people believe that harsher punishments are necessary to combat crime, then the lawmakers should listen to their constituents and pass tougher laws.""

5. ""If you don't support implementing stricter gun control measures, you must not care about reducing gun violence in our communities.""

Fallacy: Ad Hominem- Circumstantial
Explanation: This tweet attacks the motives or character of those who do not support stricter gun control measures, rather than engaging with their arguments or reasoning.

Example: ""Anyone who opposes stricter gun control laws must be in favor of more gun violence and doesn't care about keeping our communities safe.""","1. ""Snitches get stitches, that's the code on these streets #loyalty #ganglife""

This post uses the in-group language of ""snitches get stitches,"" which refers to the code of not cooperating with law enforcement or turning in fellow gang members. The culture implied by this post is one that values loyalty above all else, especially within gang communities where retaliatory violence is common.

2. ""Five-O was lurking in the hood last night, had to dip out real quick #hoodlife #sketchy""

This post uses the cultural cue ""Five-O,"" which is slang for the police. The mention of ""the hood"" and the need to ""dip out"" quickly implies a culture where law enforcement presence is seen as a threat, and individuals must be cautious and evasive in order to avoid trouble.

3. ""Don't mess with the cartel, they don't play games #cartellife #dangerous""

This post refers to the cartel, a criminal organization involved in drug trafficking and other illegal activities. The use of the term ""cartel"" and the warning not to mess with them implies a culture of fear and violence, where individuals must tread carefully to avoid retaliation from powerful and dangerous criminal organizations.","1.

4. ""Crime is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. We need to address root causes like poverty and lack of opportunity #CrimePrevention""

4. ""It's important to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of crime and how to protect ourselves #crimeawareness""

5. ""Let's work together to create a safer environment for all by reporting any suspicious activity to the authorities #communitywatch""

Post 4 uses an Explain tactic by providing information about the importance of educating ourselves and our children about the dangers of crime and how to protect ourselves. This post elaborates on the topic of crime awareness and prevention, providing details on why it is important to be informed and proactive in staying safe.","It is unlikely that any of the posts in a coordinated campaign about crime would use an Excite tactic to elicit positive emotions such as joy or excitement, as the topic of crime is typically associated with negative emotions.

4. ""It's time to hold our elected officials accountable for addressing crime in our city. Let's demand action and real solutions to keep our communities safe. #crimecontrol""

The enhance tactic is used in post #1, as it encourages the topic-group to continue discussing the issue of rising crime rates and working together to address it. The other posts focus on different aspects of crime prevention and control, advocating for specific solutions or actions.","Post 1: ""Crime rates have been steadily decreasing over the past decade, thanks to community policing efforts and social programs that address root causes of criminal behavior.

Post 3: ""Crime is destroying our cities and putting law-abiding citizens at risk. It's time for a zero-tolerance approach to crime and for our leaders to prioritize public safety above all else.""

Post 2 uses a Distort tactic by suggesting that the only way to address crime is through tougher sentences and increased police presence, overlooking the potential benefits of community policing and addressing root causes of criminal behavior. This distortion alters the main message of the topic by narrowing the focus to punishment rather than a holistic approach to crime prevention.","Post 1: ""Crime rates are on the rise in our neighborhood.

Post 3: ""I can't believe how many people are being affected by crime in our city. It's heartbreaking to see the impact it's having on families and communities.""

Post 4: ""Have you ever tried the new coffee shop downtown? Their lattes are amazing and it's a great spot to relax and unwind.""

Post 2 uses the Distract tactic by discussing a completely different and irrelevant topic (the sun and universe) instead of staying on the subject of crime.

1. National Signing Day for football recruits.
2. Welcoming new players to the team.
3. Highlighting specific positions such as defensive backs, offensive linemen, quarterback, tight ends, wide receiver, defensive tackle, and linebacker.
4. Mention of high schools and football programs where the new recruits are from.
5. Use of hashtags such as #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnIT.","1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy exists in these posts because they all seem to be celebrating and announcing signings for SVSU football. This fallacy suggests that because a large group of people are doing something or believe something, it must be the correct or desirable thing to do. 
Example: ""RT @svsu_football 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐎𝐅𝐅𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋""

2. Ad Populum Fallacy: This fallacy is also present in the posts because they are appealing to the audience's desire to belong to a popular group or movement. 
Example: ""RT @svsu_football 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐎𝐅𝐅𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋"" 

3. Appeal to Tradition Fallacy: This fallacy can be seen in the repetition of the same type of post with different names and positions, suggesting that this is the traditional way to announce signings. 
Example: ""RT @svsu_football 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐎𝐅𝐅𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋""
