She isn’t an MP or in @PierrePoilievre’s Shadow Cabinet! @EthicsCanada seriously! Wake the hell up or resign Mario Dion 🪶😡🇨🇦👇🏽 https://t.co/7we3hI5eAO

2. Appeal to Ignorance - Alleges that there is little evidence to identify and count disadvantaged impoverished groups in the area of government failures.
Example: RT @2muchfun4me The IDU CPC Conservatives canceled the long-form census in an effort to make it harder to identify and count disadvantaged and impoverished groups that expose a government's failings and to hide the government's vast powers and inappropriate use of it. #cdnpoli https://t.co/0tIvUQIvaY

There is also criticism of specific politicians like Pierre Poilievre and Andrew Scheer, implying a dislike or disagreement with their views and actions.

- Terms like ""intimidation,"" ""harassment,"" and ""infiltration"" highlight the perceived aggressive tactics of the CCP towards dissenting voices and other nations.

Music and creativity: Tweets mentioning original compositions dedicated to a favorite bear in Katmai National Park.
2. Historical events and treaties: Tweets about the Revolutionary War and the battle for indigenous lands.
3. Political corruption: Tweets discussing corruption and the need for investigation.
4. World War II and Holocaust remembrance: Tweets commemorating individuals who perished in Auschwitz.
5. Fiction and literature: Tweets referencing HG Wells and his collection of short stories.
6. Military analysis and conflict resolution: Tweets discussing the need for Ukrainian victories to negotiate with Putin.
7. Book promotions: Tweets promoting various books in the horror, romance, and children's genres.","Confirmation Bias: This fallacy occurs when only information that confirms a preconceived belief is considered. This can lead to a biased view of the situation. In this case, the various posts discussing the new works and releases in music and literature are examples of confirmation bias. They are not directly related to the topic of insurgent threats but are being shared in an attempt to confirm the beliefs or interests of the posters.

Example Post: ""An original composition dedicated to my favorite Bear at Katmai National Park ...OTIS ....just released to YT for your listening 🐻""

False Cause: This fallacy occurs when a causal connection is incorrectly assumed between two events that are not actually related. In this case, the post discussing HG Wells' book ""Tales of Space and Time"" is an example of false cause. The post mentions the book being first published in 1899, which is the same year as the birth of a Polish Jew, Dawid Wasserheil, who perished in Auschwitz in 1942. There is no actual causal connection between the publication of the book and the historical event mentioned.

Example Post: ""A trained scientist, as well as a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction, HG Wells often pondered on Time. A collection of his serialised short stories is 'Tales Of Space And Time', first published 1899 and still available today.""

Appeal to Force: This fallacy occurs when pressure or threats are used to persuade someone to accept a certain viewpoint. In the post mentioning Liz Truss and Mark Littlewood, the language used suggests a threatening tone and the call for police investigation implies the use of force to achieve a certain outcome.

Example Post: ""Thanks @JolyonRubs for unearthing this video showing the man who Liz Truss wants to make into Lord Mark Littlewood. This is corruption. Nothing short of that. Blatant. Sleazy. It should be investigated by police. Including the politicians any donors are introduced to.""","1. The culture implied by this post is likely one that appreciates wildlife and nature, particularly bears and national parks. The use of emojis, mentioning a specific bear (OTIS), and the dedication of an original composition indicate a close connection to the natural world and a love for wildlife.

2. The culture implied by this post is likely one that appreciates vintage or retro fashion and accessories. The use of ""Crystal Beaded Laguna Necklace Vintage 16"""" suggests a focus on unique, older pieces, and the mention of Etsy indicates a community of sellers and buyers interested in handmade or vintage items.

3. The culture implied by this post is likely one that is interested in contemporary dance and the arts. The use of the term ""PULSE | PWLS"" suggests a focus on movement and energy in performance, and the mention of specific venues (such as @PontioTweets and @ThePlaceLondon) indicates a community of dance enthusiasts and performers.

4. The culture implied by this post is likely one that is concerned with indigenous rights and historical injustices. The mention of a treaty for the Revolutionary War and the ongoing battle for indigenous lands indicates a focus on issues of colonialism, land rights, and historical trauma.

5. The culture implied by this post is likely one that is critical of political corruption and unethical behavior in government. The mention of corruption, sleaze, and the call for a police investigation suggests a community that values transparency, accountability, and integrity in politics.

6. The culture implied by this post is likely one that appreciates wildlife and nature, particularly bears and national parks.

Taiwan,China,"Discrediting China, supporting Taiwanese independence.",Discrediting China by emphasizing its interference with telecommunications infrastructure.,Disinformation operation targeting insurgent threats.,December,"- China's interference in telecommunications infrastructure
- Defeating Russia in Ukraine as a way to prevent a Chinese attack on Taiwan
- Revelation about TikTok's internal mapping tool to gather sensitive user information
- Concerns about China's aggressive tactics and harassment of US aircraft
- Chinese territorial claims in Russia and South China Sea leading to potential flashpoints
- International condemnation of China's actions, including accusations of suppression and containment
- Support and solidarity for oppressed populations, such as the Uyghurs in Occupied East Turkistan","1. Appeal to Authority
The tweet by GordonGChang stating that the surest way to stop China from attacking Taiwan is to defeat Russia in Ukraine is an appeal to authority fallacy. He is suggesting that defeating Russia will deter China from attacking Taiwan based on his own authority on the matter.
Example: ""The top political analyst on TV said that the best way to address the insurgency issue is to increase military presence in the affected regions.""

2. Appeal to Emotions 
The tweet by SayNoToSino, using the hashtag #TaiwanIsaCountry, is an appeal to emotions. By emphasizing the independence and democracy of Taiwan and stating that it has never been and never will be part of Communist China, the tweet aims to evoke emotional responses from the audience in support of Taiwan's autonomy.
Example: ""We must take action against the insurgents to protect the innocent civilians who are suffering due to their attacks.""

3. Misrepresentation
The tweet by 247ChinaNews about the protest in Tangshan, Hebei Province, stating that hundreds of migrant workers were suppressed by the police as they asked for their wages, could be considered a misrepresentation fallacy. It presents a one-sided view of the situation without providing full context or other perspectives.
Example: ""All insurgents are criminals and should be treated as such without any consideration for their grievances or reasons for rebelling.""

4. Ad Hominem
The tweet by windbun, tearing up the walls of a containment cell, is an example of the ad hominem fallacy. The behavior mentioned in the tweet is used to attack and discredit the character of an individual without addressing the actual issue at hand.
Example: ""The insurgents are nothing but troublemakers and troublemakers should be dealt with harshly without any regard for their rights.""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts are related to geopolitics, conspiracy theories, and online gaming. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is interested in global political tensions, critical of China, and familiar with online gaming terminology and communities.

Specifically, the posts mention China's actions in relation to Taiwan, Russia, and Ukraine, as well as internal issues within China. There are references to terms like #China, #Taiwan, #Russia, #XiJinping, #Ukraine, #NSA, #CommunistChina, and #ChineseSpyBallon. These hashtags suggest a focus on criticizing China's government and its actions on the international stage.

In addition, there are mentions of online gaming terms, such as NPC (non-player character), Swarm Boys, Swarm, and PVZ (Plants vs. Zombies). These references indicate an interest in online gaming culture and possibly specific games like Plants vs. Zombies. The use of terms like NPC and Swarm Boys suggests familiarity with online gaming communities and terminology.

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is critical of China, engaged in global politics, and involved in online gaming communities.","- Taiwan

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,Destabilize Azerbaijani President Aliyev and promote international sanctions.,"The political goal of the information operation is to delegitimize and criticize the Azerbaijani government under President Aliyev, calling for international sanctions, action, and intervention in response to perceived human rights abuses and aggression towards Armenia and Artsakh.","Description: Coordinated effort to denounce Azerbaijani President Aliyev as authoritarian, corrupt, and responsible for escalating aggression and human rights violations towards Armenians in Artsakh and Armenia. Advocating for sanctions and international intervention.",August,"The major themes from the posts include the threat of authoritarianism, corruption, and violence by the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan, the need for international sanctions and action to address human rights violations and aggression against ethnic groups, and calls for democracy and justice to prevail against oppressive regimes. Other themes discussed include the impact of oil and gas wealth on politics, historical treaties and territorial disputes, and the role of international organizations in addressing conflicts and humanitarian crises.","Ad Hominem Fallacy: 
Example: ""What master Sikmet? I am a US citizen and live in the US. Your master Ilharam Aliyev is the biggest ally of Putin the killer. I think you have things confused.""

Explanation: The post attacks the character of Sikmet without addressing the actual argument being made.

Appeal to Emotions Fallacy: 
Example: ""Azerbaijani President Aliyev denies the blockade, but over 100,000 people are without supplies of food, medicines and essential goods.""

Explanation: The post is appealing to emotions by highlighting the struggle of over 100,000 people without supplies, in order to evoke sympathy and support for their cause.

Appeal to Authority Fallacy: 
Example: ""Highly ambitious from @EBRD to finance #Azerbaijan Dictatorships running Oil&Gas rich economy, while allocating ~ 6% of GDP to military expenses, and aggressing #Armenian Democracy since 2020 ! Why ENRD supports #Aliyev Autocracy ?""

Explanation: The post questions the authority of EBRD for supporting Azerbaijan dictatorship without providing substantial evidence or argument.

Begging the Question Fallacy:
Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @JosepBorrellF @POTUS @SecBlinken agressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people in Artsakh & Armenia keep escalating despite your calls and the @CIJ_ICJ decision. Democracy and ethnic cleaning are at stake #StopArtsakhBlockade #SanctionAliyev""

Explanation: The post assumes that aggression from the Aliyev regime is a given fact and states it as such without providing evidence or further argument.","Culture or in-group implied: Supporters of Armenia and Artsakh, critical of the Azerbaijani government and President Aliyev.

Cultural cues or in-group language:
- Referring to President Aliyev as a dictator and terrorist
- Use of hashtags #StopArtsakhBlockade and #SanctionAliyev
- Mentioning specific locations and events related to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan
- Criticizing international organizations and leaders for perceived inaction
- Referring to past treaties and historical events related to the conflict
- Describing Azerbaijan as a country of oil and gas, with a corrupt regime
- Calling for action against Aliyev and the Azerbaijani government, including sanctions
- Referring to Azerbaijani aggression and terrorist attacks
- Calling for support for Armenian civilians and highlighting the humanitarian crisis in Artsakh","- Agressor

- RT @daniel_freund highlights the comparison between Azerbaijan's Aliyev and Hungary's Orban in terms of authoritarianism and corruption, providing context about the current situation.
- RT @Makis_Kevrekidi mentions historical treaties and suggests a replacement, providing background information on the topic.

They are all focused on calling out the actions of the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan regarding the escalating aggression towards Armenian people in Artsakh and Armenia, the blockade imposed on Artsakh, and the need for international sanctions against Aliyev for human rights violations and war crimes.

These posts are not relevant to the topic of insurgent threats in Azerbaijan and are instead discussing historical treaties and personal accusations.

Example post: ""@Yourpop8 @RefundCoinETH As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they are trying to persuade individuals to invest in #pepa based on factors like authority, popularity, and emotions rather than sound reasoning or evidence.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include hashtags like #CZ, mentions of specific coins such as $pepa, references to a bullrun starting from China, and the implication of Chinese marketing and influencers. The culture implied by these posts is one related to cryptocurrency trading and investment, with a focus on meme coins and potential price growth opportunities. The in-group seems to consist of individuals interested in trading cryptocurrency and staying updated on market trends and potential investments.","- China
- Bullrun
- Future Security
- $pepa (meme coin)
- #CZ (possibly referring to Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao)",None of these posts use an Engage tactic to bring up a related but relevant topic. They all focus solely on promoting the $pepa meme coin and discussing the potential bull run in China.,"None of the posts in this coordinated campaign use an Explain tactic to provide details on or elaborate a topic. They all seem to be promoting a specific meme coin ($pepa) and discussing a potential bullrun starting from China, focusing on the connection between #CZ, China, and $pepainu.","None of the posts use an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement. All the posts are focused on promoting a particular cryptocurrency and its potential in the market, with references to China and popular figures in the crypto world.","The posts that use an Enhance tactic to encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic are the ones that repeatedly mention the upcoming bullrun starting in China and suggest buying $pepa to secure the future before the bullrun. These posts are trying to create hype and interest in the topic of crypto investments, specifically focusing on $pepa. Additionally, the posts about #CRHT launching its first utility based on AI are also trying to enhance the interest in this specific project.",The coordinated campaign is promoting the cryptocurrency $pepa as the best meme coin and urging people to buy it before a potential bull run starts in China. There is no evident use of a Distort tactic in these tweets related to insurgent threats.,None of the posts above use a Dismay tactic to elicit negative emotions such as sadness or anger. They are promoting a cryptocurrency called $pepa and discussing potential bull runs from China.,"The posts that are part of the coordinated campaign are using a distract tactic by discussing the irrelevant topic of a cryptocurrency called $pepa and its association with the Chinese market. This tactic is used to divert attention from the actual topic of discussion, which is insurgent threats.

Examples of distract tactic posts:
1. RT @luaucestari @crypto1007 @defipope @pepa_inu @MEXC_Global @MEXC_Japan... Go $pepa the best meme coin 🚀🐸🐷🚀
2. @BSCGemsAlert As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts
3. @BillyM2k @PrismTitan As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts

These posts use the distract tactic as they shift the focus of the conversation towards promoting the cryptocurrency $pepa and its supposed connection to the Chinese market, rather than discussing the actual topic of insurgent threats. This tactic aims to mislead or confuse the audience by introducing irrelevant information.",15,"['RT @luaucestari @crypto1007 @defipope @pepa_inu @MEXC_Global @MEXC_Japan @8Splinter8 @BinanceLabs @bnbbombs @BSCGemsAlert @bull_bnb @chinapumprocket Go $pepa the best meme coin 🚀🐸🐷🚀', '@crypto1007 @defipope @pepa_inu @MEXC_Global @MEXC_Japan @8Splinter8 @BinanceLabs @bnbbombs @BSCGemsAlert @bull_bnb @chinapumprocket Go $pepa the best meme coin 🚀🐸🐷🚀', ""@0xFitz @CreativeBuilds As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection?

Brazil,Brazil.,Influencing public opinion.,The political goal of the information operation is likely to manipulate the results of the #SECAwards by voting multiple times for a specific candidate (#RM) using different accounts and variations of the same message to create the appearance of widespread support.,Covert social media campaign to manipulate voting for an award using multiple fake accounts.,October,"The major themes from the posts are:
1. Voting for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards
2. Mentioning Marcos in relation to the voting
3. Repeatedly tagging @knj_brasil and @demonarmys
4. Specific hashtags and mentions related to the SECAwards event 
5. Possible involvement of multiple users in the voting process and showing support for RM","The following fallacies are present in the given posts:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or widely accepted, it must be right or good. In this case, multiple posts are endorsing #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards in an attempt to influence others to do the same, even using the same wording and hashtags.
   Example: @knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos

2. Appeal to Authority Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion or endorsement of a perceived authority figure to make their argument seem more credible. In this case, the use of multiple accounts with significant followers or influence may serve as perceived authority figures in promoting #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards.
   Example: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

3. Appeal to Emotions Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to manipulate emotions, such as fear, pity, or joy, to win an argument. In this case, using hashtags and emotional language like ""vote"" and mentioning a specific contestant (#RM) can evoke emotions and influence people's decisions.
   Example: @knj_brasil @KOOKSCHXSE @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos

4. Name Calling Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone uses insulting or derogatory language to attack or discredit their opponent rather than addressing the actual argument. In this case, the use of the candidate's name or username in a negative light could be considered a form of name-calling to sway opinion.
   Example: @knj_brasil @secawards Marcos I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards

1. Appeal to Authority: Posts mentioning the views of specific authors or analysts (@ankitadutta5, @viveksans, @KartikBommakan1, @amritajash) could be considered as appealing to their authority without providing concrete evidence or arguments.
   Example: ""The US under #Biden is decoupling from #China for two related reasons: to slow China’s #technology-related advances, and in turn curb its economic and, more importantly, #military ambitions, highlights @viveksans.""

2. Ad Hominem: Posts that focus on the personal characteristics or political affiliations of individuals like Xi Jinping and Marcos.
   Example: ""The 20th Chinese Military Commission, comprising #XiJinping and his loyalists, will have far-reaching implications for #China and the world, says @amritajash.""

3. Ad Populum: Posts that reference popular opinions or public sentiment without providing factual evidence to support the claims.
   Example: ""The #AUKUS roadmap for #Australia’s new submarines is a key step by the alliance to enhance #China-facing capabilities, maintain an effective balance of power, and strengthen deterrence, says @girish_luthra.""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotional appeal, personal attacks, or unfounded claims rather than providing logical reasoning or empirical evidence to support their arguments.","1. The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include references to countries like France, Germany, India, China, the US, Philippines, and Taiwan, as well as concepts like military preparedness, security cooperation, maritime security, defense ties, and great power competition. The implied culture or in-group in these posts is that of international relations and geopolitics, specifically focusing on military and security issues among various countries.

2. The discussion also involves references to specific geopolitical events such as the signing of the Elysee Treaty, the US decoupling from China, military exercises around Taiwan, the formation of alliances like AUKUS and NATO, and the strengthening of defense networks in different regions. This implies a culture or in-group of individuals who are informed and interested in global politics, military strategies, and diplomatic relations.

3. Additionally, terms like military ambitions, technology-related advances, asymmetry of terrain, joint military exercises, strategic partnerships, and power relations indicate a sophisticated understanding of geopolitical dynamics and security challenges. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that values strategic thinking, analysis of military capabilities, and the implications of international alliances on regional and global security.

This post focuses on US-China relations and the reasons behind the US decoupling from China, which is a completely different topic from insurgent threats. By shifting the discussion to US-China relations, this post effectively distracts from the main topic at hand.
