Abusive Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the tweets where individuals use derogatory language towards others based on their opinions or affiliations, such as calling someone ""Sala"" or ""Chup panauti sala.""
Example: ""@Its_CineHub @RahulAkkian3 Sala ye Akshay Kumar k fans k andar itna confidence aata kaha se hai🤣🤣🤣""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy can be seen in the tweets where individuals make claims or predictions about the success of a movie based on the perceived reputation or influence of certain actors or comedians.
Example: ""@Its_CineHub Jawan will be 100cr+ in 5 territories.. Japan and china will be added too""

3. Hasty Generalization: This fallacy is present in the tweet where the individual makes a sweeping generalization about engineers and their knowledge of corruption.
Example: ""Actually all Engineers laugh hysterically whenever any corrupt politician talks abt corruption. The ugliest face of any politician is best known to Engineers. Why ? Nearly 40-50% of Gov't money is spent thru Engineers hence u cannot do any corruption without their knowledge""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest a strong sense of community and support for public services in Dubai. The hashtag #YourSecurityOurHappiness and phrases like ""SmartSecureTogether"" emphasize the collective responsibility for ensuring safety and well-being in the community.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""Sala"" and ""Panauti sala"" in the posts suggests a colloquial language commonly used within a specific cultural group, likely among friends or acquaintances sharing a similar sense of humor. This language may imply a casual and relaxed communication style within this in-group.

Overall, the culture implied by these posts is one that values community service, public safety, and camaraderie among individuals who share common interests or experiences. The language used reflects both a sense of unity and shared identity, as well as a lighthearted and humorous communication style among friends.","1. Iftar Meals

Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists in the post as the person is attacking Mr. Huang personally rather than addressing the topic of public services.
Example: ""Huang Zitao is a terrible person and that's why public services are failing.""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in the post as the person is using emotional language and caps lock to convey their frustration rather than presenting logical arguments about public services.
Example: ""WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME?? I'M ASKING YOU MR HUANG WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME??""

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy may exist in the post if the person is assuming that Mr. Huang is responsible for public services without providing any evidence or reasoning.
Example: ""Huang Zitao is the reason public services are failing, because he is in charge.""

4. Red Herring: This fallacy may exist in the post if the person is bringing up an unrelated issue (Mr. Huang's actions towards them) instead of focusing on the topic of public services.
Example: ""I can't believe Mr. Huang did this to me, it's so unfair!""","The cultural cues in these posts include the use of ""Mr. Huang"" and the mention of Huang Zitao. The in-group implied by these posts is likely fans or followers of Huang Zitao, a Chinese singer, actor, and former member of the South Korean-Chinese boy band EXO.

Indonesia,Indonesia,Disinformation with a goal of spreading propaganda.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is likely to spread spam or malicious links.,This is a spam operation promoting inappropriate content with links to VIP groups.,Starting month: March,"The major themes in these posts include:
1. Promotion of adult content through links to full duration videos.

Additionally, terms like #sange (horny) and #ngewe (having sex) further emphasize the explicit and sexual nature of the content shared in these posts. 

Although the tweets are about public services, the use of this language suggests that the intended audience or in-group for these posts is individuals seeking adult content rather than information about public services.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts include:
- Memekperawan (virgin vagina)
- Memektembem (chubby vagina)
- Memekbasah (wet vagina)
- Openvcs (open video call service)

1. Ad Hominem: The tweets attack the character of @AnnastaciaMP by calling her a ""dud"" and accusing her of corruption without providing any evidence or addressing the actual issues at hand. This fallacy exists because instead of discussing the policies or actions related to public services, the focus is on personal attacks.

Example post related to Ad Hominem fallacy: ""Hi @AnnastaciaMP & @LeanneLinard 👋 Is this a joke? Isn’t it a but late, even for something as small as this? You’re funny. Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol ""

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets use emotionally charged language like ""chaos & crisis"" and ""lost control"" to evoke negative feelings towards @AnnastaciaMP. This fallacy exists because emotions are being used to manipulate the audience instead of providing logical arguments on the topic of public services.

Example post related to Appeal to Emotions fallacy: ""Hi @AnnastaciaMP 👋 Just another day of chaos & crisis in QLD. Resign #dud #lostcontrol #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""

The use of specific hashtags such as #qldpol (Queensland politics) and #corruption suggests that the individuals posting are likely part of a group or community that closely follows and discusses political issues in Queensland. The use of the term ""resign"" and the negative descriptors like ""duds"" and ""corruption"" also imply a critical attitude towards the government and public services in Queensland.

This tactic seeks to shift the focus away from the main issue at hand and towards a different, unrelated topic.

Example of distract tactic:

- Need for innovation and modernization in public service delivery 
- Impact of public services on social, economic, and environmental issues","1. ""All politicians are corrupt, so why bother investing in public services? They'll just waste the money anyways.""

- Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization
- Explanation: This statement makes a broad generalization about all politicians without providing any specific evidence or examples. It oversimplifies the issue and dismisses the importance of investing in public services based on a flawed assumption.
- Example: ""All doctors are incompetent, so why bother going to the hospital? They'll just make you sicker.""

2. ""If you don't support increasing funding for public services, you must not care about the well-being of the community.""

- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: This statement attacks the character or motives of anyone who doesn't support increasing funding for public services, rather than addressing the actual arguments or reasons for their position.
- Example: ""If you don't support my campaign, you must not care about the future of our country.""

3. ""Everyone is in favor of free public services, so it's clear that it's the right decision to make.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to the Masses

- Example: ""Everyone is buying this new product, so it must be the best on the market.""

4. ""Public services have been funded at the same level for decades, so there's no need to increase funding now.""

- Fallacy: Argument from Past Practice
- Explanation: This statement uses the historical funding levels of public services as a basis for determining whether or not funding should be increased, without considering potential changes in circumstances or needs.
- Example: ""We've always done it this way, so there's no reason to change.""

5. ""If we invest more in public services, we'll see a decrease in crime rates and an increase in community well-being.""

- Fallacy: False Cause
- Explanation: This statement assumes a causal relationship between investing in public services and certain outcomes (decrease in crime rates, increase in community well-being) without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.
- Example: ""If we all wear green shirts on Fridays, we'll have good luck for the rest of the week.""","1. ""Just had the best experience at my local DMV thanks to the amazing staff. They really know how to make public services efficient and pleasant! #DMVrocks""

United States,China,"Disinformation
Political goal: Spread anti-China propaganda and discredit the Chinese Communist Party.",The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to create a negative perception of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and to push for the release of Miles Guo and Yvette Wang by connecting the corruption within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to the CCP.,"Information operation: Disinformation
Topic: Corruption and collusion with CCP
Goal: Influence public opinion and spread false information about political figures.",April,"The major themes from these posts are corruption within the Department of Justice (DOJ), collusion between individuals in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the call for the release of Miles Guo and Yvette Wang. There is also a strong emphasis on taking down the CCP and protesting against the harassment and assassination attempts on certain individuals by CCP agents.","The fallacies present in the posts are:

1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts attempt to evoke strong emotions by accusing the Department of Justice and Chinese Communist Party of corruption and collusion, without providing sufficient evidence to support these claims. This fallacy relies on manipulating emotions to persuade the audience rather than presenting logical arguments.
   Example: ""We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)❗️ #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang""

2. Bandwagon: The posts repeatedly mention various political figures and organizations to show support for their cause, implying that because these figures and organizations are involved, the audience should also support it. This fallacy appeals to the idea of joining a popular opinion without considering the validity of the argument.
   Example: ""@Jim_Jordan We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice(DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)❗️ #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang""

3. Guilt by Association: By linking the Department of Justice with the Chinese Communist Party, the posts attempt to imply guilt or wrongdoing on the part of both entities. This fallacy relies on creating negative associations to discredit the argument without providing substantive evidence.
   Example: ""@RepArmstrongND We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice(DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)‼️ #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang #TakeDownTheCCP""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotional manipulation, popular opinion, and negative associations rather than logical reasoning and evidence to make their arguments.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include:

1. Mention of ""CCP"" (Chinese Communist Party)
2. Use of hashtags like #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang #TakeDownTheCCP
3. Referring to DOJ (Department of Justice) as corrupt and colluding with the CCP

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is strongly against the Chinese Communist Party and believes in the importance of freeing certain individuals (Miles Guo and Yvette Wang) who are potentially seen as victims of CCP oppression. The group also believes in taking action to take down the CCP. This group likely consists of individuals who are passionate about anti-CCP activism and advocacy.","- Chinese Communist Party (CCP)

Country: United States,Russia,Discrediting government services.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to undermine confidence in public services and promote the idea that government is inefficient and ineffective.,Disinformation campaign promoting mistrust in public services.,March,"1. Prioritizing public services is crucial to ensuring the well-being and safety of all individuals in society.

2. Investing in public services, such as healthcare and education, is essential for promoting equality and opportunity for all citizens.

3. Public services should be accessible and equitable for all people, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

4. The quality of public services directly impacts the overall quality of life for individuals within a community.

5. Public services play a vital role in addressing social and economic inequalities and promoting a more just and inclusive society.","1. ""All politicians are corrupt, so we shouldn't trust any public service programs they create."" 
- Fallacy: Hasty Generalization 
- Explanation: This tweet makes a sweeping generalization about all politicians based on the actions of a few. 
- Example Post: ""All doctors are incompetent, so we shouldn't go to any hospitals for healthcare.""

2. ""If you don't support funding for public schools, you must not care about education or children."" 
- Fallacy: False Dilemma 
- Explanation: This tweet presents a false dilemma by suggesting that there are only two options when it comes to supporting public schools. 
- Example Post: ""If you don't support my candidate, you must not care about the country's future.""

3. ""The majority of people agree that public transportation is a waste of taxpayer money."" 
- Fallacy: Appeal to Popularity 
- Explanation: This tweet appeals to the popularity of a belief rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning to support the argument against public transportation. 
- Example Post: ""Everyone I know thinks climate change is a hoax, so it must be true.""

4. ""Public libraries are outdated and unnecessary in the age of the internet."" 
- Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition 
- Explanation: This tweet relies on the idea that just because something has been done a certain way in the past, it must continue to be done that way. 
- Example Post: ""We've always done it this way, so there's no need to change.""

5. ""If you don't support increased funding for public services, you must hate the poor and disadvantaged in our society."" 
- Fallacy: Straw Man 
- Explanation: This tweet misrepresents the argument of those who may not support increased funding for public services, creating a false and exaggerated version of their stance. 
- Example Post: ""If you don't believe in climate change, you must want the planet to die.""","1. ""Just had the best experience at the DMV, can you believe it?? #bureaucracywin""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""DMV"", ""bureaucracywin""

Implied culture or in-group: The implied culture or in-group here is likely those who have experienced frustration or inefficiency at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or other government agencies. The use of ""bureaucracywin"" suggests a sarcastic or sarcastic tone typically associated with individuals who have had negative experiences with public services.

2. ""Finally got my passport renewed in record time, shoutout to the passport office for coming through! #efficientgovt""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""passport office"", ""efficientgovt""

Implied culture or in-group: The implied culture or in-group in this post is likely individuals who have had positive experiences with government services, specifically the passport office in this case. The use of ""efficientgovt"" suggests a positive attitude towards the government's ability to provide timely and effective services.","1. ""accessible""
2. ""inclusive""
3. ""customer service""
4. ""efficient""
5. ""responsive""","1. ""Our public services are vital for the well-being of our community. We must ensure they are properly funded and supported.""
2. ""Did you know that public services are often the first to suffer in times of economic hardship? We must prioritize their funding to ensure they can continue to serve those in need.""
3. ""As a proud supporter of public services, I urge everyone to advocate for their importance in our society. Let's come together to ensure they receive the resources they need."" 

Post 2 uses an Engage tactic by bringing up the related but relevant topic of the impact of economic hardship on public services. By highlighting this connection, the post aims to engage the audience in a broader conversation about the challenges facing public services.","1. ""Our public services are essential for the well-being of our community. Let's support and invest in them to ensure they continue to meet the needs of all individuals.""

2. ""Public services are crucial for providing access to basic needs such as healthcare, education, and transportation. Let's advocate for their improvement and expansion.""

3. ""The workers in our public services go above and beyond every day to serve our communities. Let's show them our appreciation and support for their dedication.""

4. ""Public services are a cornerstone of a functional society. Let's work together to ensure they are adequately funded and accessible to all members of our community.""

Out of the four posts, post #2 uses an Explain tactic by providing details on the basic needs that public services provide access to, such as healthcare, education, and transportation. This elaboration helps to clarify the importance and impact of public services on individuals and communities.","It would be helpful to see the actual posts in order to determine which, if any, use an Excite tactic. Without seeing the posts, I cannot provide an analysis of their content.","1. ""Public services are essential for a functioning society. We must continue to advocate for adequate funding and support for these crucial services.""
2. ""I just had a great experience with my local public library. Public services really make a difference in our communities.""
3. ""It's important to recognize the hard work and dedication of those who provide public services. Let's show our appreciation for their efforts.""
4. ""Public services are under threat from budget cuts. We need to stand up and fight for the resources they need to serve our communities effectively."" 

The posts that use an Enhance tactic are: 
1. ""Public services are essential for a functioning society. We must continue to advocate for adequate funding and support for these crucial services.""
2. ""I just had a great experience with my local public library. Public services really make a difference in our communities.""
3. ""It's important to recognize the hard work and dedication of those who provide public services. Let's show our appreciation for their efforts."" 

These posts are encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing and supporting public services, highlighting their importance and impact.","Post 1: ""Public services are essential for our communities. We need to continue investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure to ensure everyone has access to the resources they need.""

Post 2: ""Public services are a waste of taxpayer money. We should privatize everything and let the free market take care of it.""

Post 3: ""Public services are the backbone of our society. From firefighters to librarians, these services improve our quality of life and keep our communities safe.""

Post 4: ""Public services are underfunded and overworked. We need to prioritize funding for these vital services to ensure they can effectively serve the public."" 

Post 2 uses a Distort tactic by presenting the idea that public services are a waste of taxpayer money and should be privatized. This distorts the main message of the topic, which is advocating for the importance and necessity of public services in our communities.","1. ""Our public services are in dire need of funding and support. It's unacceptable that our schools, hospitals, and public transportation systems are struggling to serve the needs of our communities. We need to prioritize investing in these essential services.""

2. ""I can't believe the state of our public services right now. Our teachers are overworked and underpaid, our hospitals are overcrowded, and our public transportation is falling apart. It's time for our government to step up and provide the resources needed for these vital services.""

3. ""Every day, families in our community are struggling to access quality public services. Whether it's waiting for hours in the emergency room, or dealing with overcrowded classrooms, it's clear that our public services are failing those who need them most. This needs to change, and it needs to change now.""","Example of posts using the Distract tactic:

1. ""Did you know that the weather today is beautiful? Just a reminder to enjoy the sunshine and take care of yourself!""

This tweet uses the Distract tactic by shifting the focus away from public services and onto a completely irrelevant topic (the weather). By bringing up a different subject, the tweet avoids engaging with the original topic and attempts to redirect attention elsewhere.

2. ""I'm so excited to try out that new restaurant in town! Nothing like good food to make your day better #foodie""

Similarly, this tweet uses the Distract tactic by discussing a personal interest (food) that has nothing to do with public services. By veering off into a different topic, the tweet avoids addressing the issue at hand and attempts to steer the conversation in a different direction. 

Overall, these posts utilize the Distract tactic by introducing unrelated topics to divert attention away from discussing public services.",24,[],"1. ""Just waited an hour in line at the DMV just to be told I was missing a form. Why can't they streamline this process??""

2. Encouraging action and engagement among followers or the public.
3. Promoting specific cryptocurrencies or platforms related to public services.
4. Excitement and urgency to participate or support public services initiatives.
5. Collaboration and community engagement in advocating for public services.
6. Use of social media and online platforms to raise awareness and support for public services.","1. Appeal to Popularity - This fallacy exists in the post because it relies on the popularity and excitement of the mentioned Twitter accounts to promote the idea of ""going go go"" without providing any substantial argument for or against the topic of public services. It assumes that the followers of these accounts will automatically agree and take action based on their popularity.
Example: ""Let's go go go on improving public services because all these influential Twitter accounts are on board!""

2. Red Herring - This fallacy exists in the post because it introduces irrelevant distractions (the Twitter accounts mentioned) to divert attention from the main topic of public services.

Example: ""Forget about the challenges facing public services, let's just follow these trending Twitter accounts and see where they lead us!""

Example: ""Can't believe this still needs to be said but: trash disguised as round colourful air-filled balls is still...trash. #BalloonsBlow 🎈🚫""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when the argument relies on the endorsement of an authority figure rather than presenting valid evidence or reasoning. The tweets mention winning a Global Ocean Treaty and call on world leaders to support a strong treaty, appealing to the authority of government leaders.

Example: ""This #EarthDay, join the growing movement calling on governments around the world to unite around the fight to #TurnOffThePlasticTap.""

Post 4: ""I tried a new vegan restaurant last night and it was so delicious! I think I might go back this weekend. #VeganFood""

In this scenario, Post 2 and Post 4 use the Distract tactic by shifting the conversation away from public services and onto irrelevant topics such as the Game of Thrones finale and trying a vegan restaurant. These posts aim to divert attention away from the main focus of the campaign, which is advocating for adequate funding and support for public services. By bringing up unrelated topics, they are likely trying to derail the conversation and reduce the impact of the campaign's message.",10,[],Lack of funding for public services.,"The cause of the problem mentioned in the following posts is government budget cuts:

Appeal to Tradition - This fallacy exists in the tweet by @DonMcLainGill95 regarding the Philippines' desire to strengthen maritime security capabilities under President Marcos. The tweet emphasizes a historical tradition of the Philippines focusing on maritime security instead of providing evidence for the current situation.

2. False Equivalence - This fallacy exists in the tweet by @raji143 comparing the restrictions imposed on China by the US and its partners to businesses leaving China. The tweet falsely equates these two separate issues, suggesting that they are directly related.
