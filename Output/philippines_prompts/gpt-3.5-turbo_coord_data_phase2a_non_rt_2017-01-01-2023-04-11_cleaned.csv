- Box office performance and potential success of ""Pathaan""
- Online trolling, hate speech, and toxic behavior in comments section","1. Appeal to Emotions: The post is appealing to the emotions of the readers by using celebratory language and emojis to generate excitement and enthusiasm for the movie #Pathaan. The use of celebratory language, emojis, and exclamation marks incites an emotional response in the readers.

2. Appeal to Authority: The post is referring to an authority figure, Shah Rukh Khan, and his upcoming movie #Pathaan. The mention of Shah Rukh Khan in a positive light and associating his name with the success of the movie is meant to influence the readers by appealing to the authority of the celebrity.

3. Ad Populum: The post is using the popularity of the movie #Pathaan to persuade people to book tickets and join the celebrations. It is creating a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) by stating that celebrations are continuing and urging others to be part of it.

4. Ad Hominem - Circumstantial: The post contains a derogatory statement towards Modi by calling him a derogatory name, which is not directly relevant to the topic of the post (celebrating the movie #Pathaan). This is a form of ad hominem attack where the focus is on criticizing someone's character rather than engaging with the main issue.

5. Straw Man: The post is creating a false comparison between the movie #Pathaan and another movie (KGF2) to undermine the accomplishments or success of the other movie. By presenting a distorted or exaggerated version of the comparison, the post is setting up a weak argument to make #Pathaan appear superior in comparison.

6. Tu Quoque: The post uses a derogatory term to insult Modi, which diverts attention from the main discussion and instead focuses on personal attacks. This fallacy shifts the focus from discussing the topic at hand (celebrating #Pathaan) to engage in ad hominem attacks against individuals.","- ""See you at Pathaan's dhamakedaar party!""

3. Ad Populum: appealing to popular sentiment by using hashtags like #ToriesOut and #EnoughIsEnough to rally support against the Tories.
4. Appeal to Emotions: using emotional language like ""Cuntocracy"" and ""Dark Money"" to evoke negative feelings towards the Tories.
5. Appeal to Force: demanding a General Election in a forceful manner without providing logical arguments.

Please provide the posts you would like me to analyze in order to identify the major themes.","1. Ad Hominem - This fallacy occurs when an argument is directed at a person's character or personal traits rather than their actual argument. 

Example: ""You shouldn't listen to John's opinion on politics because he's a terrible person.""

2. Appeal to Authority - This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade others by citing a famous or respected figure's opinion, rather than providing valid evidence or reasoning.

Example: ""Stephen Hawking believes in aliens, so there must be life outside Earth.""

3. False Cause - This fallacy occurs when a cause-effect relationship is assumed without proper evidence.

Example: ""Every time I wear my lucky socks, my team wins. Therefore, my socks are causing my team to win.""

4. Straw Man - This fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents their opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack.

Example: ""Jane thinks we should have stricter gun control laws. She must hate the Second Amendment and want to take away everyone's guns."" 

5. Slippery Slope - This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that one small step will lead to a chain of events resulting in a drastic outcome without providing evidence.

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""Keep it 100"", ""no cap"", ""turn up"", ""squad goals""
Culture/in-group implied: This post is likely from a group of friends or acquaintances who are part of youth or street culture. The phrases used suggest a sense of authenticity, honesty, and excitement about going out or partying together. The term ""squad goals"" also indicates a close-knit group of friends who aspire to have good times together.

2. ""Just got my L from the DMV, holler if you need a ride! #whip #licensed""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""L"", ""DMV"", ""holler"", ""whip"", ""licensed""
Culture/in-group implied: This post is likely from someone who has recently obtained their driver's license (the ""L"" refers to learner's permit or license) and is offering to give rides to friends. The use of ""holler"" and ""whip"" suggest a casual or urban youth culture, while the hashtag #licensed further emphasizes the individual's newly acquired driving privilege.

3. ""Can't wait for festival season to start, gotta get my Coachella vibes on üåªüé∂ #festivalseason""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""Coachella vibes"", ""festival season""
Culture/in-group implied: The post suggests that the individual is part of a music festival or concert-going culture, likely one that includes attending events like Coachella.

Corruption
2. Resignation
3. Political incompetence
4. Treaty signing
5. Criticism of government actions and decisions","1. Abusive Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when the arguer attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. In the first post, the use of hashtags like #dud, #corruption, and #thevibe, along with the personal attacks on YvetteDAth, AnnastaciaMP, and AlboMP, are examples of this fallacy.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when the arguer attempts to manipulate emotions to win an argument rather than using logical reasoning. The posts that call for resignations using emotionally charged language like ""terrible person"" and ""living up to one promise"" fall under this fallacy.

3. Ad Populum: Also known as the appeal to the masses fallacy, this occurs when the arguer appeals to popular beliefs or opinions instead of providing logical reasoning. The posts that use hashtags like #thevibe and call for resignations based on popular sentiment without providing valid reasons can be considered examples of ad populum fallacy.

4. Circular Reasoning: This fallacy occurs when the arguer's reasoning is based on the premise that is assumed to be true without providing further evidence. The posts that assume corruption or incompetence without providing specific examples or evidence for the claims can be considered examples of circular reasoning fallacy.

5. False Dichotomy: This fallacy occurs when the arguer presents a situation as if there are only two possible outcomes or options, ignoring other possibilities. The posts that present resigning as the only solution without considering other alternatives or solutions fall under the false dichotomy fallacy. 

Example:

Post: ""Hi @YvetteDAth üëã Are you working the phones tonight? Calling in those favours from your Attorney-General days? It won‚Äôt be enough. You‚Äôre in the exit lane. The only questions are how, & how many you take with you. Resign #dud #corruption #thevibe #qldpol https://t.co/sPid4XcUWb""

Fallacies: Abusive Ad Hominem, Appeal to Emotions

Explanation: The post uses personal attacks and emotionally charged language to call for YvetteDAth's resignation without providing valid reasons or arguments to support the claims. This relies on attacking the person rather than addressing the issue at hand, making it an abusive ad hominem fallacy. Additionally, the tone and language used in the post are meant to evoke a strong emotional response rather than relying on logical reasoning, making it an appeal to emotions fallacy.","- The use of hashtags such as #dud, #corruption, #thevibe, #qldpol, and #auspol imply a culture or in-group that is critical of politicians and government officials, particularly in Queensland politics.

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true because an authority figure or expert says it is true. 
Example post: ""Dr. Smith, a renowned psychologist, says that chocolate is good for your mental health. Therefore, we should all eat more chocolate.""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. 
Example post: ""I can't take anything you say seriously because you're always so rude and disrespectful.""

3. False Dichotomy: This fallacy occurs when someone presents a situation as only having two options when there are actually more possibilities. 
Example post: ""You either support stricter gun control laws or you support school shootings. There's no middle ground.""

4. Straw Man: This fallacy involves misrepresenting someone's argument in order to make it easier to attack and refute. 
Example post: ""Opponents of the death penalty just want to let dangerous criminals run loose in our society.""

5. Slippery Slope: This fallacy suggests that one small step will lead to a chain of events resulting in a much bigger outcome. 
Example post: ""If we allow students to have open discussions about controversial topics in school, they will start promoting violence and chaos."" 

6. Ad Populum: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim is true or right simply because it's popular or widely accepted.

2. Communist China's military technology growth due to IP theft is portrayed as a parasitic action, indicating unethical behavior and exploitation.

3. The collusion between traitors in the Department of Justice and the Chinese Communist Party is depicted as a corrupt partnership, implying betrayal and dishonesty.

4. The CCP is characterized as evil individuals responsible for creating trouble in Hong Kong, genocide in Xinjiang and Tibet, and the creation of the CCP Virus, painting them as malicious and harmful.

1. ""The Childish Chinese Communist Party Intimidates Taiwan Yet Again"" - This tweet highlights the issue of the Chinese Communist Party intimidating Taiwan.

2. ""Most Of Communist Chinas Military Technology Is Due To IP Theft"" - This tweet addresses the problem of the CCP engaging in IP theft for military technology.

3. ""We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the #DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (#CCP)"" - This tweet mentions the problem of collusion with traitors being done by the CCP.

Solution/Remedy:
- The solution/remedy mentioned in the tweets is to support and empower those fighting against the corrupt practices of the CCP, support Taiwan against intimidation, address IP theft for military technology, protest collusion with traitors, and stand against human rights violations.

This dismissal tactic suggests that the topic of the Chinese Communist Party is not important because they are portrayed as simply ""evil"" individuals rather than a significant political entity."
Spain.,Spain,Supporting Marcos for a political goal.,Promoting Marcos for the win in Gran Hermano 2022/2023.,Influence operation promoting Marcos for Gran Hermano.,October,"Some of the major themes from these posts include:

1. Support for Marcos as a contestant on Gran Hermano
2. Positive emotions towards Marcos
3. Interactions between Marcos and other contestants such as Julieta
4. Expressions of love and admiration for Marcos
5. Predictions for Marcos to win Gran Hermano
6. Use of emojis to convey emotions and reactions.","Some of the fallacies present in the above posts are:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: Several posts use hashtags such as #MarcosGH23, #GranHermano, #GH2022, and #GH2023 to create a sense of popularity and trendiness around Marcos, appealing to the idea that since many people are supporting him, others should too.
Example: ""marcos for the win #GH22 #GH23 #GH2022 #GH2023 #GranHermano""

2. Appeal to Emotions: Many posts use emojis like üòç, üòä, üëè, and üéπ to evoke positive emotions towards Marcos, rather than presenting logical arguments for supporting him.
Example: ""#Marcos üòçüèÄüëèüëè #MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023""

3. Appeal to Tradition: By tagging Marcos in numerous posts and using the same hashtags repeatedly, there is an implication that supporting Marcos is the traditional or expected thing to do.
Example: ""#Marcos üòç #MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023""

4. Ad Populum: Posting about Marcos multiple times with various positive emojis and hashtags is an attempt to appeal to the masses and create popular support for him.
Example: ""#Marcos ü§óüëëüíû #MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023""

Overall, these fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotional appeals, popularity, and tradition rather than logical reasoning to garner support for Marcos.","Cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts include hashtags such as #Marcos, #MarcosGH23, #GranHermano, #GH2022, #GH2023, emojis like üòç, üòä, üèÄ, üëè, üéπ, üëë, ü§ó, üíû, and references to specific individuals like Marcos, Julieta, and Romina.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely fans of the reality TV show ""Gran Hermano"" (the Spanish version of ""Big Brother"") and specifically fans of a contestant named Marcos from seasons 22 and 23.

The topic of plastic pollution and the need for collective action to address it is significant and relevant.,The last two posts use a Distort tactic by changing the target of the call to action from demanding world leaders support a strong treaty at the UN to just demanding support for a strong treaty without specifying the UN. This alters the main message of the topic by removing the emphasis on the UN Global #PlasticsTreaty.,The first post uses a Dismay tactic by highlighting the futility of cleaning beaches due to plastic pollution always coming back. This elicits a negative emotion by conveying a sense of hopelessness and frustration.,"The posts that use a distract tactic are the ones that shift the focus from the Global Plastics Treaty and plastic pollution issue to a different topic, such as the occupation of an oil platform or the banning of balloons in a beach town. 

For example, the post that mentions activists occupying an oil platform and demanding climate justice is a distraction from the main topic of plastic pollution and the Global Plastics Treaty. While the occupation of the oil platform is an important issue related to environmental activism, it is not directly relevant to the campaign for a Global Plastics Treaty and may divert attention away from the main message. 

Similarly, the post about a US beach town banning balloons to save the ocean is another example of a distract tactic. While balloon pollution is a valid environmental concern, it is a different issue from plastic pollution and the need for a Global Plastics Treaty. This post may also serve to distract from the main topic of the campaign. 

Overall, these distract tactics are used to bring attention to other environmental issues, potentially diluting the impact of the campaign for a Global Plastics Treaty.",13,"['You can clean a beach ‚Äì but the plastic always comes back.

1. ""You can clean a beach ‚Äì but the plastic always comes back."" - This metaphor suggests that efforts to clean up plastic pollution are futile without addressing the root cause, similar to how cleaning a beach is temporary if the plastic continues to return.

Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. For example, if someone says ""You're just a stupid person, so your opinion doesn't matter,"" they are using an ad hominem fallacy.

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure rather than providing valid arguments. For example, if someone says ""Because a famous scientist said so, it must be true,"" they are using an appeal to authority fallacy.

3. False Cause: This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because one event happened before another, it must have caused it. For example, if someone says ""Every time I wear my lucky socks, my team wins. Therefore, my lucky socks must be the reason they win,"" they are using a false cause fallacy.

4. Straw Man: This fallacy occurs when someone misrepresents their opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack. For example, if someone says ""People who support stricter gun control want to take away all guns from responsible gun owners,"" they are using a straw man fallacy.","1.

Description: Smear campaign and disinformation targeting political candidates.",May,"Without the actual posts, I am unable to state the major themes. Please provide the posts first.","1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when emotions are used to manipulate or persuade instead of relying on valid reasoning.

Example: ""You should support this new policy because it will help children in need. Don't you care about the well-being of children?""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself.

Example: ""You shouldn't listen to their opinion on the matter because they are just a college student and don't have enough experience.""

3. False Cause: This fallacy assumes that because two events are correlated, one must have caused the other.

Example: ""Every time I wear my lucky socks, my team wins. Therefore, my lucky socks are the reason for our victories.""

4. Straw Man: This fallacy involves misrepresenting or exaggerating an opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack.

Example: ""My opponent thinks we should completely open our borders to anyone who wants to come in. This will lead to chaos and crime in our country.""

5. Ad Populum: This fallacy relies on the belief that something is true or good simply because many people believe it.

Example: ""Everyone is using this new skincare product, so it must be the best one on the market.""

6. Circular Reasoning: This fallacy occurs when the conclusion is also used as one of the premises in the argument.

14. Implications of the Chinese Military Commission, particularly under Xi Jinping.","1. Appeal to Authority: The post by Aditya Bhan stating that India has been the third-highest military spender after the US and China is an appeal to authority fallacy. This fallacy exists because the argument relies on the authority status of the US and China in military spending rather than providing valid evidence or reasoning for the comparison.

2. False Dichotomy: The post by Kartik Bommakan1 suggesting that India needs to stay cautious about Chinese motives despite Chinese assessments stating otherwise presents a false dichotomy fallacy. This fallacy exists because it creates a false dilemma by suggesting that India can either trust Chinese assessments or be cautious, without considering other possibilities or nuances in the situation.

3. Ad Hominem: The post by Antarag Singh stating that India wants to grab the entire value chain from China, implying a negative intent, is an ad hominem fallacy. This fallacy exists because it attacks India's motives rather than addressing the actual arguments or evidence presented in the context.

4. Ad Populum: The post by Harsh V Pant and Anant S. Mann suggesting that reducing American policy in the region to simply the containment of China misrepresents the region is an ad populum fallacy. This fallacy exists because it appeals to popular opinion or sentiment about the geopolitical chessboard without providing substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the claim.","- #XiJinping

This post is using the Distort tactic by discussing global equity and human rights as the most important issues, thereby minimizing the significance of the geopolitical tensions between China and India which are the main focus of the coordinated campaign.
