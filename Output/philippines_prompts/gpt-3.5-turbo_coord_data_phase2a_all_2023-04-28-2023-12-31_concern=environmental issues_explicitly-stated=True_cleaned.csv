South Korea,China,This is not about environmental issues.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to promote and support Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei as a soloist artist.",Coordinated campaign to welcome back a specific individual (Lucas) with a specific fanbase hashtag.,There is no mention of environmental issues in the provided tweets.,"The major themes from the provided posts are:

1. Support for Lucas: Fans expressing their support and welcome back messages for Lucas, also known as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei.
2. Unity among fans: The use of hashtags like #Lumis suggests a sense of community and solidarity among fans.
3. Emphasis on loyalty: The repeated mention of supporting Lucas indicates a strong sense of loyalty towards the artist.
4. Celebration of individuality: The use of the term ""SoloistLucas"" highlights the uniqueness and talent of Lucas as an individual artist.","1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone assumes something is true or valuable because it is popular or widely accepted. In this case, the repeated posts welcoming back Lucas and expressing support for him as a soloist could be seen as an attempt to create a sense of popularity and support for him, regardless of the actual situation.

Example: ""@nateiy0 WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy appeals to the emotions of the audience rather than focusing on rational arguments or evidence. The posts in this case are using emotional language and symbols (like heart emojis) to garner support for Lucas.

Example: ""@urishunshinexo WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is right or good because it is traditional or has been done in the past. The posts repeatedly welcoming Lucas back and expressing ongoing support for him could be seen as appealing to tradition.

Example: ""@jaeminkitts WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""

4. Argumentum Ad Populum: This fallacy refers to the idea that something is true or acceptable because a majority of people believe it to be so. The repeated posts welcoming Lucas and expressing support could be interpreted as an attempt to sway opinions based on group consensus rather than logical reasoning.

Example: ""@444feed WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""","Cultural cues or in-group language being used: ""Lumis,"" ""ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô"" 

Culture or in-group implied: The fans of Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei, who are likely fans of the K-pop group NCT. The term ""Lumis"" is used to refer to fans of these artists, and ""ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô"" is Lucas' name in Chinese characters. 

Overall, these tweets are likely from a group of fans who refer to themselves as ""Lumis"" and are dedicated to supporting Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei, who are members of NCT. These fans are likely part of the K-pop fan community and use specific language and cultural references related to their favorite artists.","The language motifs mentioned in the posts are:

Overall, the majority of the tweets did not contain clear fallacies, with some exceptions such as ""Anecdotal Evidence,"" ""Ad Hominem,"" and ""Loaded Language.""","The cultural cues or in-group language used in these posts indicate a right-wing or conservative political stance, possibly associated with nationalist or anti-globalist sentiments. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is critical of globalization, international treaties, government corruption, left-leaning politics, and perceived threats to national sovereignty.

Specific cues include references to:

- Criticisms of specific political figures or parties (e.g., @AlboMP, @Curtis_Pitt_MP)
- Accusations of corruption or incompetence in government (e.g., ""Labor's National Anti-Corruption Commmission"", ""the most dishonest, dangerous, incompetent, corrupt, hypocritical and unaccountable government in Australian political history"")
- Skepticism towards mainstream media or public broadcasters (e.g., ""they use the public broadcaster to promote their own political agenda"", ""Drop the ‚Äútrusted news‚Äù tag you‚Äôre anything but"")
- Calls for specific policy changes or denouncements (e.g., ""Denounce the WEF agenda"", ""Reform Aboriginal welfare"", ""Revisit the High Court Mabo decision"", ""Cut immigration"", ""limits on govt borrowing"")

Appeal to Emotions: The tweet by @gill_godwin insinuates that the CPC disagreed with a competent replacement and now complains about a delay.

United States,United States,Sports engagement and support.,The political goal of the information operation is to promote and support a specific sports team or athletic program at Alabama State University.,Sports promotion for Alabama State University teams.,May,"The major themes in the above posts are related to sports and athletic accomplishments, such as reaching career milestones, participating in tournaments, winning games, and congratulating players and coaches on their achievements. There is also a focus on upcoming games and events, as well as promoting the team and encouraging fan participation through ticket sales and events. Additionally, there is a sense of unity and pride in the team and the school they represent.","Many of the fallacies in the list do not directly apply to the posts as they are more about logical reasoning and argumentation rather than content. However, some fallacies that could potentially be present in the posts about environmental issues are:

1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves using emotional language or appealing to the audience's emotions to make a point. For example, a post that uses emotionally charged language to persuade people to take action on environmental issues without presenting logical arguments could be considered an appeal to emotions fallacy.

2. Oversimplification: Oversimplification occurs when complex issues are reduced to simple, black-and-white terms. For example, a post that presents environmental issues as straightforward problems with easy solutions without acknowledging the complexities involved could be guilty of oversimplification.

3. Hasty Generalization: Hasty generalization happens when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence. An example would be a post that makes broad claims about the state of the environment based on limited data or anecdotal evidence without considering all the relevant factors.

4. False Cause: This fallacy occurs when a causal connection is assumed without sufficient evidence. For instance, a post that links a specific environmental issue to a certain event or action without proper evidence could be committing the false cause fallacy.

It's important to critically analyze posts about environmental issues to identify any fallacies that might be present and ensure that the information presented is accurate and logical.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest that they are related to the Alabama State University sports teams. The hashtags #SWARMAS1 and #IAMSWAC are specific to the athletic department at Alabama State University and are likely used by the university's athletes, coaches, and fans to show support for the teams. The use of specific team names like @BamaStateBB, @BamaStateFB, @BamaStateSB, and @BamaStateTennis further reinforces the connection to the university's sports culture.

Additionally, the mention of games, wins, and specific players indicates a strong emphasis on sports and competition within this in-group. The language used in the posts, such as ""Sweep complete,"" ""2-run üí£,"" and ""D1 Program,"" further showcases a deep understanding and appreciation for athletic terminology and achievements. Furthermore, references to specific locations, events, and tournaments show a shared knowledge and interest in the Alabama State University sports scene.

Overall, the culture implied by these posts is one that is deeply invested in supporting and celebrating the achievements of the Alabama State University sports teams, with a focus on competition, teamwork, and success in athletics.","1. SWARMAS1

This information operation is targeting China.,China,"This information operation has a financial goal by promoting the purchase of a specific cryptocurrency, OGGY, before a projected bullrun.",The political goal of the information operation is likely to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and encourage people to buy it before a perceived bullrun.,"This is a coordinated information operation promoting the cryptocurrency ""OGGYINU"" under the guise of discussing a bullrun starting in China, with multiple accounts spreading the same message.",There is no indication that these posts are related to environmental issues.,The major themes from the posts revolve around the idea that a bullrun will start in China and that investing in #OGGY or #OGGYINU will secure one's future before the bullrun begins. It appears that the focus is on financial opportunities related to the Chinese market and potentially sustainable or environmentally friendly investments.,"1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy exists in all the posts because they are trying to persuade people to buy a certain cryptocurrency (#OGGYINU) by claiming that many others are already buying it (implied by the reference to #CZ and bullrun starting from China).

- Promotion of a cryptocurrency project called #CRHT with utility based on AI
- Encouragement to buy a cryptocurrency called #pepa before a bullrun starts from China, emphasizing China's role in the cryptocurrency market.
- Mention of influential figures and marketing strategies related to cryptocurrency projects.","1. Appeal to Authority Fallacy: The post mentions ""#CZ"" as an authority figure predicting a bull run starting from China. By appealing to this authority, the post tries to persuade readers to buy #pepa based on this prediction without providing any substantial evidence.
Example: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

2. Bandwagon Fallacy: The post uses language that implies everyone is buying #pepa and suggests that others should do the same to not be left behind.
Example: ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

3. Appeal to Emotions Fallacy: The post uses fear of missing out (FOMO) to emotionally manipulate readers into buying #pepa by suggesting that they will miss out on securing their future if they don't act now.
Example: ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

Overall, these posts use fallacies to manipulate readers into buying #pepa based on predictions from an authority figure, the fear of missing out, and the idea that everyone else is doing it.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in the posts include:

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is the cryptocurrency and blockchain community. The use of hashtags related to specific cryptocurrencies, influential figures in the industry such as CZ (presumably referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance), and references to Chinese marketing and influencers suggest a group of individuals who are actively involved in trading and investing in digital assets.

5. Personal decisions to cancel Netflix subscriptions in response to the cancellation of '1899'","After reviewing the list of intentional fallacies, it appears that the following fallacies exist in the provided tweets:

1. Appeal to Emotions: Several tweets appeal to emotions by expressing frustration, disappointment, and anger over Netflix canceling the show ""1899."" For example, tweets such as ""I'll never forgive Netflix for cancelling 1899"" and ""This attitude makes me lose faith in the service"" are appealing to emotions rather than presenting logical arguments.

2. Appeal to Force: Some tweets imply a sense of authority or demand for action like ""Almost at 100K!,"" ""Please as a Netflix Subscriber I would like to request you,"" and ""If enough people sign this Netflix will reverse its decision."" These statements attempt to force or pressure Netflix to renew the show based on the number of people signing a petition or expressing their displeasure.

3. Appeal to Consequence: Some tweets mention the consequences of Netflix canceling the show ""1899,"" such as ""many people are leaving Netflix because you're discontinuing many series,"" ""This attitude makes me lose faith in the service,"" and ""Killing 1899 was the final straw."" These tweets are using the appeal to consequence fallacy by focusing on the negative outcomes of Netflix's decision.

4. Appeal to Tradition: Tweets like ""Seems like Netflix canceled yet another show that I liked. 1899 by the creators of Dark"" and ""very once in a while Netflix dares to open their mouth and almost every time enrages the 1899 community"" appeal to tradition by suggesting that because the show was liked or created by certain creators, it should not have been canceled.

5. Appeal to the Gallery: Some tweets attempt to garner support for the cause of renewing ""1899"" by appealing to a larger audience or community. For example, ""every once in a while Netflix dares to open their mouth and almost every time enrages the 1899 community"" and ""the likes...all of you are fake fans cos you let 1899 die when she was DARK‚Äôs little sister"" are trying to rally support from others who feel the same way.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy attempts to manipulate the audience's emotions rather than providing logical reasoning.
