The tweets also convey a sense of anticipation among fans and emphasize the importance of experiencing the movie on the big screen.","The fallacies present in these posts are:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy is present in posts that appeal to the popularity of an idea to persuade others to believe or do the same. The numerous tweets encouraging people to book tickets and join the #Pathaan party imply that everyone is doing it and you should too.

Example post: ""An action spectacle to be gloriously remembered! #Pathaan continues to rule hearts all over...

2. Appeal to Emotions: These posts appeal to the emotions of the audience to persuade them to take action. The use of phrases such as ""Downtown #Dubai shines with #PathaanTrailer üòçüî• The world is going gaga over #Pathaan"" creates an emotional response in the reader.

Example post: ""Downtown #Dubai shines with #PathaanTrailer üòçüî• The world is going gaga over #Pathaan ‚Äî make sure you don't miss out!!

3. Appeal to Tradition: The posts encourage the audience to celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50 and experience the movie in cinemas rather than through recording videos or spoilers, appealing to the tradition of watching movies in theaters.

Example post: ""All set for the biggest action spectacle? A humble request to everyone to refrain from recording any videos, sharing them online and giving out any spoilers.

Criticism of the Conservative Party in the UK, labeling them as corrupt and in alliance with oligarchs.
2. Calls for a general election and a general strike to push for political change.
3. Accusations of corruption within the government, specifically mentioning individuals such as Zahawi and Mark Littlewood.
4. Concerns about authoritarianism, human rights violations, and repression of free speech under the current government.
5. Expressions of frustration and anger about the state of the country, including issues of wealth inequality, division, and declining standards of living.
6. Calls for accountability and justice for corrupt politicians involved in questionable deals and actions.
7. Criticism of the media, particularly the BBC, for allegedly protecting the government and not adequately covering scandals and issues.
8. Use of hashtags such as GTTO (Get The Tories Out) and SaveOurNHS to rally support for political change.","1. Appeal to Emotions: Many of the tweets use emotional language to evoke strong negative feelings towards the Conservative Party, such as ""CorruptConservatives"" and ""Thieves, charlatans, crooks all joining hands to fleece the tax payer."" This fallacy exists because it attempts to manipulate the audience's emotions rather than provide logical arguments.

Example: ""Thanks @JolyonRubs for unearthing this video showing the man who Liz Truss wants to make into Lord Mark Littlewood. This is corruption. Nothing short of that. Blatant. Sleazy. It should be investigated by police. Including the politicians any donors are introduced to.""

2. Ad Hominem: Some tweets attack individuals directly, such as calling Zahawi a tax evader and suggesting he should be arrested. This fallacy exists because it focuses on attacking the character of the individual rather than addressing the actual topic or argument.

Example: ""I will not cheer if Zahawi is just sacked. That is Westminster GAMES. He needs to be ARRESTED and put before a jury. ELITE CORRUPTION is rife and it so much wider than this one man. We need to proactively root out ELITE CORRUPTION. Of course Sunak won‚Äôt. Sadly nor will Starmer.""

3. Sweeping Generalization: Several tweets make sweeping generalizations about the Conservative Party, such as referring to them as ""CorruptTories"" and associating them with corruption without providing specific evidence. This fallacy exists because it makes broad, unsupported claims.

Example: ""Thirteen years Simon, thirteen long years. Everything is worse than before you came to power. Corruption in government seems rife. The rich get richer while we are poorer, sicker, angrier and more divided than ever before, what a legacy. #GeneralElectionN0W""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include:

These tweets attack Pierre Poilievre and the CPC party's leader personally, rather than addressing their policies or arguments directly.

Another example is the Appeal to Emotions fallacy, which occurs when an argument is made based on manipulating emotions rather than using logic or reason.

- The first post from @NFSC_HAGnews warns of disruption to the global trading system if the situation in the Taiwan Strait gets out of control. This appeal to emotions is meant to create fear and urgency in the audience regarding the potential impact of the situation.

Example post: ""The CCP doesn't just want to economically destroy us. What the CCP wants is to colonize America. The reason China wages an economic war, a cyber war, or even a physical war would be to take over America in general!""

2. Ad Hominem:
- The post from @NFSC_HAGnews includes an interview with Steve Bannon where he makes derogatory statements about the Chinese Communist Party, calling them criminal. This is an example of an ad hominem attack, where the focus is on attacking the character of the CCP rather than engaging with the actual arguments or issues.

Example post: ""#SteveBannon interview with citizens of the #NFSC: The CCP is criminal!""

3. Appeal to Authority:
- In the post from @weizhenshe, there is a mention of Kevin Alan stating that Miles Guo exposed the origin of COVID and CCP infiltration in the U.S. This is an appeal to authority, relying on the credibility of Kevin Alan to bolster the claims being made about Miles Guo and the CCP.

Example post: ""#FreeMilesGuoRally Kevin Alan: Miles Guo exposed the origin of COVID. He also exposed that CCP has infiltrated the U.S. in many aspects.""

4. Loaded Language:
- The post from @SfQuantum1 includes language like ""brutal, authoritarian regime"" and ""intimidation, harassment, and media-warfare campaigns."" This loaded language is meant to evoke strong emotions and convey a negative portrayal of the Chinese Communist Party.

Example post: ""The Chinese Communist Party has been carrying out intimidation, harassment, and media-warfare campaigns against #MilesGuo, a vocal critic of their brutal, authoritarian regime.""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotional manipulation, personal attacks, appeals to authority, and loaded language to persuade the audience rather than presenting logical arguments based on evidence and reason.","1.

2. Calls for international action, such as sanctions, to address the actions of the Aliyev regime.
3. Concerns about the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the need for a peaceful resolution.
4. Criticism of Azerbaijani actions, such as violating ceasefires, blocking corridors, and using environmental activism as a guise for aggression.

They have a clear message to the üá™üá∫: ""don't sacrifice democracy for energy"" https://t.co/3UWu7rg7kc
- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: This tweet attacks the character of Aliyev by calling him a dictator, rather than focusing on the actual issue being discussed.
- Example: Calling someone a dictator does not address the topic at hand, which is the sacrifice of democracy for energy.

2. RT @edmarukyan Azerbaijan violated the ceasefire in Nagorno Karabakh. On one hand Aliyev keeps stating that they're ready to talk with NK Armenians, those who're born there, on the other hand, they attack the people who're born and live in NK peacefully. Now the world knows what Aliyev means.
- Fallacy: Straw Man
- Explanation: This tweet misrepresents Aliyev's position by portraying him as contradictory in his actions, which diverts attention from the actual issue being discussed.
- Example: Framing Aliyev as saying one thing and doing another does not address the ceasefire violation in Nagorno Karabakh.

- Explanation: This tweet implies that anyone who does not condemn Aliyev is complicit in genocide, which is a manipulative tactic to pressure individuals into taking a certain stance.
- Example: Associating lack of condemnation with facilitating genocide does not offer a valid argument for or against Aliyev and Azerbaijan.","- The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts imply a culture or in-group that is critical of the Azerbaijani government, particularly President Ilham Aliyev, and the actions of the Azerbaijani military.

2. Appeal to Authority: Some posts refer to international organizations or experts to provide credibility or support for the argument being made.
Example Post: ""From safeguarding marine biodiversity to enhancing ocean #climate resilience, there are many benefits to a strong #HighSeas Treaty. #BBNJ @IUCN""

3. Appeal to Consequence: The posts suggest that certain actions or decisions will lead to significant outcomes, such as the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Sino-Russian relations.
Example Post: ""On the other hand, the longer the Russia-Ukraine war goes on, the more damage Sino-Russian relations will do to China's ties with advanced industrial democracies, and the more dependent Russia will become on China. [4/5] @Ali_Wyne""

4. Appeal to Tradition: Some posts appeal to historical practices or traditional wisdom to support their arguments.

Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology won. Official construction started in 1977 on the coast of Bataan province. @energybants""

Themes: Sacrifice, dedication, gratitude for military service","1. ""The United States has the strongest military in the world, so we should always be prepared for any threat."" 

- Fallacy: Appeal to Authority

- Example: ""General Smith, a highly decorated military leader, says we should always be prepared for any threat, so we must listen to his expertise.""

2. ""If you don't support increasing defense spending, you don't care about the safety and security of our country.""

- Example: ""Think of all the sacrifices our soldiers make for our freedom, joining the military is the most honorable thing a person can do.""

- Example: ""Everyone knows that without a strong military, our country would be vulnerable to attacks, so we must maintain defense spending at current levels.""

5. ""If we don't invest in new military technology, we will fall behind our adversaries and put our country at risk."" 

- Fallacy: Slippery Slope
- Explanation: This tweet suggests that not investing in new military technology will inevitably lead to falling behind adversaries and risking national security.

The use of hashtags also helps to promote further engagement and awareness on the topic.","Post 1: ""Our military is prepared to defend our country against any threat.

Post 4: ""The military-industrial complex is a dangerous and corrupt system that profits off of endless war. We must dismantle it and prioritize peace."" 

The Distort tactic is used in Post 4. While the topic is about defense and military, the post shifts the focus to criticizing the military-industrial complex and advocating for peace, rather than discussing the role of the military in defending the country.","1. ""Our military veterans deserve better. As a nation, we must do more to support those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom. #SupportOurTroops""

4. ""The amount of money spent on defense could fund so many important social programs. It's time to rethink our priorities and invest in people, not weapons. #BudgetCutsNeeded""
