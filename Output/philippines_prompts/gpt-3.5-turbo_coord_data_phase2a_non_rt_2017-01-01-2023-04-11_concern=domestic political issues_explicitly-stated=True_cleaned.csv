United Kingdom,United Kingdom,"The type of political goal for the posts is to promote anti-Tory sentiment, call for a General Election, and criticize the Conservative Party's actions.",The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to discredit the Conservative Party and promote left-wing or anti-Tory sentiment among the public.,"Description: Anti-Tory disinformation operation promoting negative sentiments towards the Conservative Party, encouraging action against them such as protests and a general election. Utilizes hashtags like #CorruptConservatives, #ToriesOut, and references to oligarchy connections.",October,"The major themes from these posts include criticizing the Conservative Party as corrupt, highlighting issues related to Brexit, calling for a general election, advocating for saving the NHS, and expressing anti-Tory sentiments. There is also a focus on oligarchy and the perceived negative actions and behaviors of the Conservative government.","1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy is present in the tweets that advocate for people to join the anti-Tory movement by using hashtags such as ""#CorruptConservatives"", ""#ToriesOut"" and encouraging retweets. The fallacy here lies in trying to persuade others to join based on the idea that everyone else is doing it, without providing substantial reasoning or evidence for their claims.

Example post: ""üé∂There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in townüé∂ #FollowBackFriday Anti-Tory Retweeters Required #SaveOurNHS #UniteB1 #BuckTories #GeneralElectionNow #ToriesOut246""

2. Ad Hominem Fallacy: This fallacy can be seen in the posts that attack individual Tory members, such as Boris Johnson, without addressing their arguments or policies. It's a diversionary tactic that focuses on attacking the character of the person rather than engaging with the actual issues.

Example post: ""@AndrewGibsonMBA Absolute balderdash. The constitutional nature of the original Treaty was removed as well as a number of the contentious articles. It was not imposed on France it was adopted by the wholly CONSTITUTIONAL assembly of both houses. What has recently been imposed on the UK is CPTPP""

3. Appeal to Emotions Fallacy: The tweets use emotionally charged language and imagery to evoke negative feelings towards the Tories, such as calling them ""CorruptConservatives"" or suggesting they ran around with oligarchy members. This appeal to emotions is used to manipulate the audience's feelings rather than presenting a rational argument.

Example post: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in townüé∂ #PutinsBrexit #SewageParty #EnoughlsEnough #UniteB1 #UpRise #GeneralElectionN0W #SaveOurNHS #GTTO #ToriesOut266""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a left-leaning, anti-Conservative political culture. The use of hashtags such as #CorruptConservatives, #ToriesOut, #SaveOurNHS, #GTTO (Get The Tories Out), #GeneralElectionNow, and references to Oligarchy, Putin's Brexit, and the Sewage Party all suggest a strong anti-Tory sentiment within this group. Language like ""BuckTories"" and ""ToryMisconductTrials"" also imply a desire to see the Conservative Party held accountable for their actions. The posts also reference specific individuals within the Conservative Party, such as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, suggesting a focus on holding these politicians responsible. Overall, the culture and in-group implied by these posts are one of progressive, anti-establishment, and anti-Conservative sentiment.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts:

Ad Hominem: The posts directly attack and insult the individuals mentioned, such as calling them duds, corrupt, or terrible people.

3. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotionally charged language and insults to sway the audience's opinion. This fallacy exists because it attempts to manipulate the audience's feelings rather than presenting logical arguments.

4. Straw Man: The posts create a distorted or exaggerated version of the individuals mentioned, such as portraying them as terrible people or pushing pointless treaties. This fallacy exists because it misrepresents the individuals' positions or actions to make them easier to attack.

2. ""Everyone knows that the opposition party is full of corrupt politicians. You can't trust a word they say.""

4. Overall discussion and engagement with the TV show ""Gran Hermano.""","The following fallacies can be identified in the given posts:

1. Bandwagon: The repeated use of hashtags like #marcos, #GH2022, #GH23, etc., suggest that there is a bandwagon fallacy at play, where the idea that supporting Marcos is popular and therefore correct.

""If you don't support our candidate, then you must not care about the future of this country. #VoteForChange""

- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: The tweet attacks the character of those who do not support the candidate rather than addressing the actual issues or policies.
- Example: ""If you don't agree with my views on healthcare, then you are clearly heartless and don't care about the well-being of others. #SupportOurCause""

2. ""Everyone is talking about how great our new policy is! Join the majority and support us now. #PopularChoice""

- Fallacy: Ad Populum
- Explanation: The tweet appeals to the majority opinion without providing any valid reasoning for why the policy is actually beneficial.
- Example: ""All the cool kids are supporting our party. Why be left out? #JoinTheWinningTeam""

Tweet 1: ""Anyone who doesn't support [political candidate] is just ignorant and uneducated. #team [political candidate]""

This tweet contains the Ad Hominem fallacy because it attacks the character and intelligence of those who do not support the political candidate instead of addressing their arguments or beliefs.

2. Tweet 2: ""If we don't elect [political candidate], our country will be doomed. Don't risk it, vote for [political candidate]. #elections""

This tweet contains the Slippery Slope fallacy because it implies that electing a certain political candidate will inevitably lead to a disastrous outcome without providing any logical connection between the two.

3. Tweet 3: ""Everyone I know is voting for [political candidate], so you should too. #popularvote""

This tweet contains the Bandwagon fallacy because it attempts to persuade others to support a political candidate based on the popularity of that candidate among a certain group, rather than on their qualifications or policies.

4. Tweet 4: ""I don't understand why anyone would vote for [political candidate]. They are clearly incompetent and unfit for office. #voteblue""

Post 2: ""Can't decide what to have for dinner tonight, any suggestions?""
Post 3: ""Looking forward to my upcoming vacation, need some time away from all the craziness in the world.""

4. Use of hashtags such as #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, #EarnITüéØ
5. Celebrating the recruitment of talented athletes","One fallacy that can be observed in the tweets is the Appeal to Ignorance fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a statement is true because it has not been proven false, or vice versa. In this case, the tweets are presenting the signings of various athletes without providing any evidence or reasoning as to why the audience should care or be interested in these signings. An example post associated with this fallacy could be: ""Signed Welcome, Nick Patterson ! @Patterson9N The Quarterback from @MHSBeMOORE #NSD23 | #Swarm23ason l #EarnITüéØ"" 

Another fallacy that could be identified in the tweets is Appeal to Emotions. This fallacy occurs when someone tries to manipulate others' emotions in order to win an argument or convince them of a particular point of view. In this case, the tweets use emotional terms such as ""Signed Welcome"" and ""The athlete"" to create excitement and interest in the signings. An example post associated with this fallacy could be: ""Signed Welcome, josh Buettner ! @Buettner5103 The defensive Tackle from @NBHuronChiefs #NSD23 | #Swarm23ason l #EarnITüéØ""
