South Korea,China,Celebrity promotion.,Promoting support for Lucas/LUCAS as a soloist.,Coordinated social media campaign to welcome back Lucas with specific hashtags and messaging.,Starting Month: September,"The major themes from these posts are welcoming Lucas back and showing support for him as a solo artist, emphasizing the names he is known by (Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei), and expressing loyalty and love for him as a member of the Lumis fan community.","The fallacy present in the posts is Appeal to the Masses (Ad Populum). This fallacy occurs when someone tries to justify a belief or action by claiming that everyone else believes or does it. In this case, the posts are all expressing unwavering support for Lucas and his various personas, claiming that ""Lumis will always support you"" and using hashtags like #SoloistLucas.

Example post associated with Ad Populum fallacy:
@peachiesminegyu WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙

This post is an example of the Ad Populum fallacy because it implies that supporting Lucas is the popular or widely accepted belief among Lumis fans, and therefore, it must be the right or justified thing to do.","The cultural cues in these posts indicate that the posters are part of a fan community or fandom for Lucas, also known as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei. The term ""Lumis"" is used to refer to fans of Lucas, and the hashtags #SoloistLucas, #LUCAS, #黄旭熙 all pertain to different aspects of his identity as a solo artist and his real name in Korean and Chinese. The lion emoji 🦁 is also used as a symbol associated with Lucas. The use of his various names and the terms specific to his fan community suggest a shared culture and language among the posters, indicating their belonging to the same in-group of Lucas fans.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts:
- ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS""

These posts use the phrase ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS"" to show excitement and joy at the return of Lucas.",All the posts are part of a coordinated campaign to welcome back Lucas and show support for him. They all use the Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue with the topic of supporting Lucas as a soloist and as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei.,"The posts do not use the Distort tactic, as they are all expressing support for Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei. The topic of welcoming back Lucas is important to the fans who want to show their support for him.","There are no Distort tactics used in these posts. They all have the same message of welcoming back Lucas and showing support for him. The coordinated campaign seems to be focused on expressing support for Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei.",None of the posts use a Dismay tactic.,"All of the posts above are using a distract tactic by discussing an irrelevant topic. The posts are all promoting and welcoming back Lucas, using similar language and hashtags, but the topic of discussion - supporting Lucas as a soloist - has no relevance to the actual content of the posts.

- Calls for resignations 
- Lack of transparency and accountability 
- Ethics and integrity in leadership","1. Ad Hominem - This fallacy exists in the first and fourth posts, where personal attacks are made against individuals rather than addressing the actual issues at hand.

Example for Ad Hominem:
""Hi @AnnastaciaMP 👋 We need lockdowns. This flu sounds worse than covid. It makes people skip work & take leave for mental health issues. Or The Sleeper™ @Curtis_Pitt_MP got drunk, slept in & was hungover at work. Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""

2. Appeal to Ignorance - This fallacy exists in the second post, where the poster is demanding information that may not be readily available or relevant.

Example for Appeal to Ignorance:
""Hi @AnnastaciaMP 👋 When will you proudly announce the appointment of QLD’s new Attorney-General? What qualifications & experience do they have? What performance scores did they receive from their most recent supervisors? Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""

3. Guilt by Association - This fallacy exists in the third post, where the poster is making a broad statement about corrupt individuals in politics without providing specific evidence or reasoning.

Example for Guilt by Association:
""@Jac061272 @SuDharmapala Then investigate it and remove and charge anyone that knew and never said anything now and also then. I don’t care what side of politics any corrupt should go LNP, ALP all of them. U agree right both sides all should go if they knew?""

4. Red Herring - This fallacy exists in the last post, where the poster is bringing up an irrelevant and distracting topic related to DNA.

Example for Red Herring:
""Show us your DNA , Mr. Pascoe.""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include:
- ""Hi @AnnastaciaMP"" - indicating that the posts are addressing or calling out a specific political figure, potentially in the Australian state of Queensland
- ""Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol"" - using hashtags related to political criticism and Queensland politics
- References to specific political figures and events in Queensland politics, such as Curtis Pitt MP, Shannon Fentiman, and the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission

The culture implied by these posts is one of political activism or engagement within the Queensland political landscape.

This post is asking for detailed information about the qualifications and experience of the new Attorney-General, as well as their performance scores from previous supervisors. It is seeking to elaborate on the topic of the new appointment and gather more specific information.

The second post, asking for qualifications and performance scores of a new Attorney-General, also does not use an Excite tactic.

However, the third post, which mentions a Health Minister being caught verbally abusing a healthcare worker, does use an Excite tactic by eliciting a negative emotion of shock or outrage.","The third post uses an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing and investigating corruption within politics, regardless of political affiliations.",The second post uses a Distort tactic by focusing on unrelated qualifications and performance scores of the Attorney-General instead of addressing a specific issue or concern. The topic of qualifications and performance scores is not important in this context and serves to distract from the main point being made.,"The post that uses a Distort tactic is: ""We need lockdowns. This flu sounds worse than covid. It makes people skip work & take leave for mental health issues.""

- Hi @AnnastaciaMP 👋 We need lockdowns. This flu sounds worse than covid. It makes people skip work & take leave for mental health issues.
- Hi @AnnastaciaMP 👋 BREAKING: All-Inclusive™ Health Minister @ShannonFentiman caught verbally abusing healthcare worker.","The posts that use a Distract tactic are the ones that bring up irrelevant topics or try to shift the focus away from the main issue at hand. 

For example, the post that says ""Show us your DNA, Mr. Pascoe"" is a clear example of a Distract tactic. This statement has no relevance to the main topic being discussed, which is about calling out corruption and incompetence in politics. By bringing up the issue of DNA, the commenter is trying to divert attention away from the main discussion and create confusion or misdirection.

Similarly, the post that asks about the appointment of QLD's new Attorney-General and their qualifications is also using a Distract tactic. While it may seem like a valid question on the surface, the real intention behind it is to steer the conversation towards an unrelated topic and away from holding politicians accountable for their actions.

2. ""Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol"" - The use of the hashtag #duds and #corruption suggests the belief that the politicians are inept or corrupt.

3. ""All-Inclusive™ Health Minister @ShannonFentiman caught verbally abusing healthcare worker."" - This metaphor implies misconduct and abuse of power by the Health Minister, further reinforcing the allegations of corruption.

4. ""Are you going to send this back to Warren to investigate himself?"" - This metaphor implies a lack of impartiality and integrity in the investigation process, suggesting a need for more thorough and independent investigations.

United States,Russia,Partisan Political Goal,Promoting KSI vs Joe Fournier fight.,Misinformation operation promoting links to live streams of KSI vs Joe Fournier and Deji vs Swarmz.,September,"The major themes from these posts include live streaming events related to KSI vs Joe Fournier, Deji vs Swarmz, and Salt Papi vs Anthony Taylor. The posts also include links to access the live streams and hashtags related to the event such as #KSIFournier, #KSI, #DejiSwarmz, #Deji, and #Misfits007.","In the provided posts, the following fallacies are present:

1. **Bandwagon Fallacy:** This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or a majority believes it, then it must be true. This fallacy is present in posts that repeatedly mention live stream links and hashtags to create the illusion that many people are engaging with the content. For example, the post ""📺Live Stream #KSIFournier #KSI | #DejiSwarmz #Deji | #Misfits007 🔴 KSI vs Joe Fournier 🎥LIVE LINK👉https://t.co/ZZMAr1hC13"" is an example of the Bandwagon fallacy.

2. **Appeal to Emotions:** This fallacy occurs when someone tries to manipulate emotions to win an argument without providing valid reasoning. In the posts, the use of emojis such as 🔥 and 🏆 alongside phrases like ""Live Stream 2023"" evoke excitement and emotion in the readers, potentially influencing them to click the provided links. For example, the post ""📺Live Stream 2023🏆🥇🔥 KSI vs Joe Fournier 🎬Live:https://t.co/RswqWP7uoR #KSIFournier #KSI #Misfits007"" is an example of the Appeal to Emotions fallacy.

3. **Repetition:** Repetition fallacy occurs when a claim is repeated often enough to be perceived as the truth without valid evidence or sound reasoning. In these posts, the repeated use of hashtags, event names, and live stream links seeks to reinforce the message and attract attention. For example, posts like ""📺Live Stream KSI vs Joe Fournier 🔗Live Link🎥▶️ https://t.co/nYuxaWH0ud Deji vs Swarmz 🔗Live Link🎥▶️ https://t.co/H9htiBRxi0"" exhibit the Repetition fallacy.

These fallacies exist in the posts because they aim to persuade viewers to click on the live stream links by creating a sense of urgency, excitement, and popularity without providing substantial evidence or logical arguments.

2. Corruption and unethical behavior: Mention of politicians accepting trips, cheques, and involvement in investigations.
3. Media criticism: Comments on the media's role in shaping political narratives and potential bias.
4. Gender dynamics in politics: References to heckling of female MPs and perceptions of cowardice and arrogance.
5. International relations and foreign policy: Discussions on military bases, NATO, Russian election interference, and global treaties.
6. Environmental issues: Calls for action on global plastic pollution and the need for a strong treaty to address the issue.","1.

They are also using hashtags like #TakeDownTheCCP to express their desire to oppose and overthrow the CCP's influence.","Some language motifs mentioned in the posts include ""Spy Base,"" ""Communist China,"" ""CCP threat,"" ""DOJ,"" ""FreeMilesGuo,"" ""Cuba,"" ""CCP spies,"" ""TakeDownTheCCP,"" ""BGY tactics,"" ""money corruption,"" ""NFSC,"" ""American imperialism,"" and ""authoritarian values.""","The posts from @RepAndyBarr, @RepDustyJohnson, and @RepNewhouse use an Engage tactic by bringing up the related topic of the silencing of Miles Guo by the DOJ in connection to the CCP spy bases.","The posts that use an Explain tactic are the ones that provide specific details about the Communist China military bases in countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, and the Bahamas. These posts elaborate on the presence of military devices on cargo ships and the construction of military bases in mountains, including missile systems. These details provide more information on the topic being discussed.",None of the posts use an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement.,"The posts from @RepGallagher, @RepRitchie, @RepLindaSanchez, @RepBlaine, @RepNewhouse, @RepDustyJohnson, @repdarrellissa, @RepAndyBarr, and @RepStefanik all use an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing the issue of the Cuba Spy Base and the threat posed by Communist China.","The posts from @RepGallagher, @RepHuffman, @RepRitchie, @RepLindaSanchez, @RepBlaine, @RepNewhouse, @RepDustyJohnson, @RepJimBanks, @repdarrellissa, @RepAndyBarr, @RepStefanik, and @RepRaulRuizMD all use the Distort tactic. The topic of Chinese military bases in various countries and the silencing of Miles Guo by the DOJ is not important because there is no evidence to support these claims. The posts are spreading false information and fear about the Chinese government without any credible sources or proof. This is a coordinated campaign to push a particular narrative without basis in fact.","The coordinated campaign aims to raise awareness about the threat of Communist China's military bases in countries like Cuba, Venezuela, and the Bahamas, and highlight the silencing of whistleblower Miles Guo by the Department of Justice. All of the posts share a similar message and call to action, using hashtags like #FreeMilesGuo and #TakeDownTheCCP.

One post that uses a Distort tactic is the following:
@committeeonccp @CNN This photo proves one thing. People in China respect each other, and Chinese people are kind, including soldiers. It's the dictators who make people hurt each other! #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang #TakeDownTheCCP https://t.co/Q4qxF08KDK

This post tries to distort the main message of the campaign by portraying Chinese people in a positive light and shifting the blame onto dictators, rather than focusing on the threat posed by Communist China's military bases and the silencing of whistleblowers.","The posts that use a Dismay tactic to elicit negative emotions such as sadness or anger include:
- ""Chinese Police Harassed me for Anti-CCP Twitter Post""
- ""The Seven Deadly Sins of the CCP’s Infiltration of the United States❗️ Money Corruption⎰The Communist Party uses American money to corrupt US government officials and elites to achieve the purpose of control and enslavement💵 #MoneyCorruption #FreeMilesGuo #TakeDownTheCCP"" 

These posts highlight negative actions or consequences associated with the CCP and are meant to evoke negative emotions in the reader.","The posts that mention the topic of the Cuba Spy Base and Communist China's military bases in other countries but then transition to unrelated topics such as Nicole on Ringside Politics, Chinese police harassment, Seven Deadly Sins of the CCP's Infiltration of the United States, and CCP's changing rhetoric towards America before and after 1949 are using a Distract tactic. 

For example, the post by @committeeonccp transitions from discussing military bases to talking about Chinese people being kind and the CCP being the real problem, thus diverting the focus away from the initial topic. Similarly, the post by @PJMedia_com transitions from discussing the CCP's history with America to focusing on American imperialism, again diverting attention from the original topic of military bases.

Ad Hominem- In the following post: ""I can't take anything she says seriously, she's just a stupid teenager."" This fallacy exists because instead of addressing the argument made by the teenager, the person simply attacks their character or intelligence.

2. Appeal to Authority- In the following post: ""Well, my doctor said that this product is the best, so it must be true."" This fallacy exists because the person is using the opinion of a doctor as evidence without considering other factors or evidence.

3. Straw Man- In the following post: ""Opponents of the new policy are just heartless and don't care about the environment."" This fallacy exists because the person is misrepresenting the actual argument of opponents in order to make it easier to attack.

4. False Cause- In the following post: ""Ever since she started wearing that necklace, her luck has turned around. The necklace must be lucky."" This fallacy exists because there is no evidence to support the claim that the necklace is the cause of her improved luck.

5. Slippery Slope- In the following post: ""If we allow same-sex marriage, next thing you know people will be marrying their pets.""

- Retreating to small towns
- Zombies
- Suspense","The following fallacies exist in the posts above:

1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy occurs when something is portrayed as better or correct simply because it is popular or widely accepted. In this case, the use of hashtags like #mustread and #amreading, as well as the emphasis on the low price of $0.99, is an attempt to appeal to popularity to persuade people to buy the book.

Example: ""Out on JULY 11! #99cents After 3 long months at the ragged edge of survival, Mason, Sarah, Mackenzie and the group have retreated to back roads and small towns in order to avoid the worst of the swarms.""

2. Appeal to Emotion: This fallacy occurs when emotions are used to manipulate or persuade someone rather than relying on logic or reason. The use of words like ""suspense"" and ""zombies"" are meant to evoke feelings of fear and excitement in the reader.

Example: ""Out on JULY 11! #99cents After 3 long months at the ragged edge of survival, Mason, Sarah, Mackenzie and the group have retreated to back roads and small towns in order to avoid the worst of the swarms.""

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade others by citing an authority figure rather than presenting valid arguments. The use of hashtags like #mustread and #amreading implies that the book is worth reading because it has been recommended by others.

Example: ""Out on JULY 11! #99cents After 3 long months at the ragged edge of survival, Mason, Sarah, Mackenzie and the group have retreated to back roads and small towns in order to avoid the worst of the swarms.""","The cultural cues or in-group language used in these posts include:

- ""Mason, Sarah, Mackenzie and the group""
- ""retreated to back roads and small towns""
- ""swarms""
- #zpoc
- #suspense
- #zombies

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely fans of zombie apocalypse or post-apocalyptic fiction. The use of hashtags like #zpoc (zombie apocalypse) and the mention of avoiding swarms and surviving on back roads and small towns indicates a shared interest in this genre. The mention of specific characters like Mason, Sarah, and Mackenzie also suggests a fandom or community of readers who are familiar with these characters and their story. The emphasis on suspense and zombies further reinforces the idea that this is a group interested in this particular subculture of fiction.","- survival

Post 3: ""Did you know that the automotive industry is one of the largest in the world? It's amazing how many different car brands and models are out there to choose from."" 

Post 2 uses an Engage tactic by bringing up a related but relevant topic of looking at car magazines and dreaming about different car models. It generates conversation about cars and car shopping, which can engage other users who have similar interests.","Without the actual posts provided, it is difficult to identify which, if any, posts use an Explain tactic. However, typically in a coordinated campaign, there may be some posts that aim to provide detailed information or elaborate on a topic. These posts might include explanations of products or services, step-by-step guides, tutorials, or in-depth analysis of a particular issue. 

If any of the posts in the campaign are focused on educating the audience, providing additional information, or clarifying certain points, they could be considered to be using an Explain tactic. 

It is important for brands and organizations to vary their content and messaging in a coordinated campaign to keep the audience engaged and interested. By including posts that use an Explain tactic, they can provide value to their audience and establish themselves as knowledgeable and trustworthy sources of information.","1. ""I just tried the new dessert place in town and it was amazing! Highly recommend it to everyone 😍""

Post 3: ""Just a reminder to all my friends to continue supporting local businesses and shopping sustainably. Together, we can make a real impact on our environment and economy.""

The posts that use an Enhance tactic are Post 1 and Post 2. They both encourage the topic-group to continue discussing and taking action on the importance of recycling, reducing waste, and combating climate change. These posts aim to keep the conversation going and inspire others to make a difference.","Post 1: ""Join us for a community clean-up event this Saturday! Let's work together to keep our neighborhood beautiful.""

Post 3: ""Did you know that littering is harmful to wildlife and the environment? Join us in taking action to protect our planet. Together, we can make a positive impact.""

None of the posts use a Distort tactic.

In this case, post 3 is using a distract tactic by bringing up the weather as a completely irrelevant topic to the conversation.
