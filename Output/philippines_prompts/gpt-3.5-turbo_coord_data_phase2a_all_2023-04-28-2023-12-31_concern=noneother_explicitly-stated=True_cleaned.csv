China,China,Celebrate or support a specific individual.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is likely to promote or support the image and career of Lucas, a public figure, and potentially influence public opinion or fandom engagement.",Coordinated inauthentic behavior promoting support for Lucas (Chinese idol) with use of multiple accounts.,Starting month: December,"The major themes from the posts are support, welcome back, and loyalty towards Lucas, also known as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei. The hashtag #SoloistLucas indicates that Lucas is now a soloist, and the use of the lion emoji ü¶Å may symbolize strength and support. The repetition of the same message in multiple tweets also suggests a strong fanbase or community rallying around Lucas.","The fallacy that exists in the provided posts is ""Bandwagon."" The Bandwagon fallacy occurs when someone argues that something must be true or good because many people believe or do it. In this case, the posts are all expressing support for Lucas, using the hashtag #SoloistLucas. The repetition of the same message across multiple posts aims to create a sense of belonging and popularity, suggesting that because many are supporting Lucas, others should also do so.

Example:

The use of emojis like ü¶Å and üíõ and the repetition of the phrase ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS"" also indicate a strong sense of community and support within this fan group.

All the posts simply welcome back Lucas and express support for him as a soloist using the same message and hashtags.,"All of the posts included in the campaign are using an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion of joy and excitement. The repeated use of capital letters, emojis, and positive language like ""WELCOME BACK"" and ""Lumis will always support you"" are all designed to create a sense of happiness and enthusiasm among the audience. The inclusion of the lion emoji and the heart emoji also adds to the overall excitement and positive feeling of the posts.","All of the posts in the coordinated campaign are using an Enhance tactic as they are all encouraging the Lumis group to continue supporting Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei. The repetition of the message in multiple posts with similar wording aims to reinforce support for the individual and the group.",There are no examples of the Distort tactic in these tweets.,"None of the posts use a Dismay tactic to elicit negative emotions such as sadness or anger. The posts are all expressing support and excitement for the return of Lucas, using positive language and emojis.","In this coordinated campaign, all of the posts are focused on the topic of welcoming back Lucas, expressing support for him as a soloist.

They never had any witnesses nor an informant nor any evidence to prove corruption because it‚Äôs all projection. Pervert Jim Jordan and James Comer should be prosecuted.""

In 2007 a secret Tory handbook was released to the press which instructed, encouraged & rewarded members to obstruct and manipulate Parliamentary Commons committees. #NeverVoteConservative.""

Shame on @theJagmeetSingh!""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts indicate a group of individuals who are critical of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members, specifically targeting Pierre Poilievre, Garnett Genuis, and other prominent figures within the party. The language used suggests a left-leaning or progressive ideology, referencing terms such as ""CPC"" (Conservative Party of Canada), ""GQP"" (a derogatory term for the Republican Party in the United States), and specific individuals within the CPC like Pierre Poilievre and Garnett Genuis.

The posts also reference specific events, controversies, and policies associated with the CPC, such as allegations of election fraud, anti-worker policies, obstruction of parliamentary committees, and connections to far-right ideologies. These references imply a shared understanding and knowledge of the history and current actions of the CPC among the group posting and interacting with these tweets.

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is critical of conservative and right-wing politics, supportive of progressive or left-leaning policies, and engaged in political discourse and activism surrounding these issues in Canada. They share a common language, knowledge of specific individuals and events, and a sense of opposition to the CPC and its members.","- #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou

The posts highlight concerns about CCP propaganda, espionage, and attempts to influence US elections, as well as the silencing of whistleblowers such as Miles Guo. Additionally, they raise questions about the cooperation of American tech companies and individuals with the CCP, the presence of CCP spies in the US, and the potential military threat posed by the CCP to Taiwan.","The cause of the problem mentioned in these tweets is the influence and interference of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in various aspects of American society, including politics, free speech, espionage, and the justice system. The CCP's efforts to spread propaganda, conduct espionage, influence US elections, silence whistleblowers, and establish military bases in countries like Cuba pose a threat to American democracy, national security, and justice. The cooperation of American tech companies and individuals with the CCP further enables their nefarious activities, while the presence of CCP spies in the US compromises the country's sovereignty. This interference and manipulation by the CCP undermine American values and institutions.","The remedy for the problem mentioned in these posts is to take down the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their influence in American society. This would involve exposing and countering CCP propaganda, espionage, and attempts to interfere in US elections. It would also require protecting free speech, whistleblowers like Miles Guo, and individuals targeted by the CCP. Additionally, efforts should be made to address the cooperation of American tech companies with the CCP, the presence of CCP spies in the US, and the potential military threat posed by the CCP to Taiwan. By taking down the CCP's influence and interference, American values, democracy, national security, and justice can be preserved and safeguarded.","There are several metaphors explicitly mentioned in the tweets related to the problem, cause, and remedy:

1. ""The time for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to use military force against Taiwan is imminent."" This metaphor implies a looming threat or danger from the CCP towards Taiwan, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.

2. ""Our constant olive branch becomes an invitation to aggression."" This metaphor compares extending an olive branch to inviting aggression, suggesting that efforts towards peace and diplomacy may be taken advantage of by the CCP for their own agenda.

3. ""The Cuba Spy Base is just the tip of the iceberg."" This metaphor implies that the discovery of the spy base in Cuba is just a small indication of a much larger and more threatening presence and activity by the CCP in other countries.

4. ""The 'Fifth Column' üëâAmerican sellouts."" This metaphor refers to American individuals who are portrayed as betraying their country for the benefit of the CCP, likening them to a group working against their own nation's interests.

5. ""The alternative social media network GETTR is evolving to become more of an 'everything app' with an emphasis on protecting free speech."" This metaphor compares GETTR to an ""everything app,"" indicating that it is expanding its scope and functionality while still prioritizing the protection of free speech.","Catchphrases related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the posts include:

Therefore, it might be necessary for individuals to take a break from obsessing over Marcos and to engage in other activities and interests to maintain a healthy balance in their lives.","The metaphors mentioned in the tweets related to the problem, cause, and remedy are as follows:

Ad Hominem: 
- Example: ""@KonulikShahin I am surprised Konulik, working as an Aliyev troll, how can you say if something is nonsense or not?""
- Explanation: This is an ad hominem fallacy because the person's character is attacked (being called an Aliyev troll) rather than addressing the substance of their argument.

2. Poisoning the Well:
- Example: ""@MaryHogin ü§° Aliyev having fun with his dictator buddies. While the West calls him a ‚Äúreliable‚Äù partner. The world hypocrisy in a nutshell. All the West has the Armenian blood on their hands.""

- Example: ""This new unprovoked attack by #Azerbaijan against the #Armenians is on all of us! It is on all that chose empty words to supposedly ""urge"" the #Aliyev regime to put an end to its inhumane block of #Artsakh"" 
- Explanation: This is an ad populum fallacy because it appeals to the emotions of the general public without providing logical reasoning.

4. Appeal to Authority:
- Example: ""Democratic Artsakh can never be safe under dictatorial Azerbaijan. It has always been an independent oblast. Europe appeasing Azerbaijan‚Äôs territorial claims will lead to ethnic cleansing and genocide in Artsakh.""
- Explanation: This is an appeal to authority fallacy because the opinion of the speaker (in this case, Serj Tankian) is presented as a legitimate argument without providing additional evidence or reasoning.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts suggest a pro-Armenian and anti-Azerbaijani sentiment within the group of individuals posting.

2. Appeal to Popularity - This fallacy is present in all the posts as they all try to appeal to the audience's desire to be part of a popular trend by suggesting that everyone else is buying #pepa. This appeal plays on the fear of missing out and the desire to follow the crowd.

The use of the same message across multiple accounts suggests a coordinated campaign to drive engagement and interest in the topic.,All the posts except for the one from @rovercrc mentioning #CRHT seem to be part of a coordinated campaign using the Distort tactic. They are all promoting #pepainu and urging people to buy #pepa by suggesting a connection to a bull run starting in China.

Examples of posts using a distract tactic:
1. @itsALLrisky As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts
2. @Ashcryptoreal As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts

In these examples, the tweets start by mentioning the bull run starting in China but quickly transition to promoting #pepainu and urging people to buy it.

Example post: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

2. Bandwagon Fallacy: The tweets create a sense of bandwagon effect by repeatedly mentioning Marcos in relation to voting for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards. This implies that because Marcos is supporting this vote, others should follow suit without considering the actual merits of the artist.

Example post: @knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos

3. Ad Hominem Fallacy: The tweets unnecessarily focus on tagging and mentioning Marcos in relation to the vote for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards, which serves as a distraction from the actual content of the vote.

Example post: @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

4. Appeal to Emotion Fallacy: By repeatedly mentioning Marcos in the tweets regarding the vote for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards, the users might be trying to appeal to the emotions or loyalty of Marcos' followers to influence their voting decision.

Example post: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

5. Appeal to Popularity Fallacy: The tweets suggest that because Marcos is mentioned or endorsed in relation to the vote for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards, it must be a popular or valid choice to make, without providing any substantial reasoning behind the vote.

- Encouraging a sense of community and family within the team

Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when attacks are made against an opponent's character rather than addressing the argument itself. An example of this fallacy would be if a tweet said, ""Don't listen to any signings from @Patterson9N, he's just a biased source with no credibility.""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy happens when someone tries to bolster their argument by invoking an irrelevant authority figure. An example in this context would be if a tweet stated, ""You should trust all of @svsu_football's signings because they were endorsed by a famous sports analyst.""

3. Bandwagon: This fallacy is evident when someone argues that because something is popular or widely believed, it must be true or good. An example would be if a tweet stated, ""Join the excitement and hype of @svsu_football's signings! Don't miss out on being a part of the winning team.""
