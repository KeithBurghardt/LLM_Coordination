- Gratitude and respect for veterans","1. ""We must support increasing military spending to ensure our national security. Anyone who disagrees is unpatriotic and doesn't care about our country.""

The fallacy in this post is Ad Hominem - Circumstantial.

2. ""All our allies are increasing their defense budgets, so we should do the same to keep up with them.""

The fallacy in this post is Bandwagon. This is because the argument appeals to the popularity of a belief rather than providing solid reasoning for increasing defense spending.

3. ""We can't cut military funding because that will put our troops at risk. It's better to be safe than sorry.""

Posts 1 and 2 use an Enhance tactic by emphasizing the importance of supporting and investing in the military, and encouraging continued focus on the topic of defense and military. Post 3 also aligns with the topic, but does not explicitly encourage further discussion on the subject.","Without seeing the actual posts, I can only provide general examples of how a Distort tactic might be used in a coordinated campaign about defense and military. 

One example of a Distort tactic could be intentionally misrepresenting the facts or statistics about a country's military capabilities to make them seem more powerful or threatening than they actually are. This could be done to instill fear or create a sense of urgency for increased defense spending.

Another example could be spreading misinformation or fake news about a potential military threat in order to manipulate public opinion or justify military action. This could involve exaggerating the danger posed by a particular country or group, or fabricating evidence of their aggressive intentions.

9. Criticism of negative and divisive communication strategies used by the CPC","1. RT @wmsqc @LukaszukAB @Alberta_UCP Vote ND and stop the Smith/CPC gongshow
- Fallacy: Ad Hominem (Attacking the person rather than the argument)
- Example: Calling out the Smith/CPC as a ""gongshow"" without providing any substantial argument against their policies or actions.

2. RT @timethief @Scribulatora @JFLa21432749 When I read pro-conservative tweets the people making them never provide enough text to ascertain if they have read and do embrace the CPC policy declaration. I suspect they haven't and just accept Poilievre's misleading populist rhetoric.
- Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
- Example: Assuming that pro-conservative individuals have not read or embraced the CPC policy declaration based on a limited sample of tweets.

3. RT @ericgarland There's a law firm here in St. Louis that's implicated in: Venezuela oil sanctions, Chinese money laundering, election interference, counterintelligence investigations, and the trafficking of foster kids. And not defending clients. *Involved.* Just one firm. Get it? üòàüôÉ‚öñÔ∏è
- Fallacy: Misleading Vividness
- Example: Providing a vivid description of a law firm's alleged wrongdoings without solid evidence or details to support the claims.

4. RT @politicalham Ok, the CBC accusation is bonkers enough, but extending it to the Canadian Press? That's off the charts nuts. Unless...he's trying to discredit all MSM, a favourite ploy of authoritarian populists and fascists everywhere.
- Fallacy: Slippery Slope
- Example: Suggesting that an accusation against CBC could lead to discrediting all mainstream media outlets without proper evidence or reasoning.

5. RT @CJ_Toronto @Scribulatora @PierrePoilievre We already know that law enforcement, up to and including elements of CSIS, were leaking information to the convoy last year, so this really isn't all that big of a stretch. They're probably coordinating with the CPC.
- Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
- Example: Assuming that law enforcement and CSIS are coordinating with the CPC based on unverified information about leaks to the convoy.

6. RT @GussterMolly @CTVNews Exactly. Sit down CPC.
- Fallacy: Ad Baculum (Argument from force)
- Example: Using the phrase ""sit down"" as a way to shut down the CPC without providing any substantial argument or reason.

7. RT @grock1963 @denisebatters If anyone is associated with Beijing it is the CPC. Harper et al sold our country out to them for 31 years with FIPA.. and Little PP won't do a background check??
- Fallacy: Red Herring
- Example: Bringing up the association between the CPC and Beijing to divert attention from the main topic of discussion.

8. RT @Theobius #MPPP The Buffalo Tribune A front for Kenney's Energy Centre (War Room) and Alberta Proud and the National Firearms Association and a mercenary group. Pierre's brother Patrick and David Yurdiga, who just quit the CPC and endorsed Bernier's PPC run it.
- Fallacy: Appeal to Conspiracy
- Example: Suggesting a complex conspiracy involving multiple organizations and individuals without providing concrete evidence to support the claim.

9. RT @Red_Toryism @gtlem Her situation is worse. She did it multiple times after Kenney left. She should be gone now. At least on 5 separate occasions. I don't see any case where this looks good for Smith. CPC and media sure must be shitting bricks over it.
- Fallacy: Ad Hominem- Circumstantial
- Example: Judging the credibility of someone's situation based on their previous actions or associations with Kenney and the CPC.

10. RT @Theobius #CPC MP Michele Rempel 2020 - in Oklahoma and the ""fatuous Buffalo Declaration, a twaddle-filled 6,000-word Alberta separatist screed.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to Ridicule
- Example: Dismissing the Buffalo Declaration as a ""fatuous"" and ""twaddle-filled"" document without providing any substantial critique of its content.

3. War and conflict (from the third post about Native American rebellion against the Treaty of Paris)","1. Appeal to Emotions fallacy:
The first post is an example of the appeal to emotions fallacy because it uses words like ""new threat,"" ""swarms,"" ""strength,"" and ""courage"" to evoke fear and excitement in the reader rather than presenting logical arguments or evidence. The goal of this tweet is to appeal to the emotions of the audience to generate interest in the book being promoted.

2. Appeal to Emotions fallacy:
The second post is also an example of the appeal to emotions fallacy because it uses similar language and imagery to evoke fear and suspense in the reader. The repetition of phrases like ""new threat rising out of the swarms"" and ""city of the dead"" is designed to create an emotional response rather than a rational one.

3. Appeal to Consequence fallacy:
The third post can be considered an example of the appeal to consequence fallacy because it implies that Russia's military actions are solely intended to make itself more attractive to China. This oversimplifies the complexity of international relations and military strategy, ignoring other potential reasons for the Pacific Fleet exercises.

4. Biased Generalizing fallacy:
The fourth post is an example of biased generalizing because it implies that all men wear swim trunks, enjoy going to the beach, and are interested solely in items like cargo pocket swim trunks. This generalization is based on stereotypes and does not take into account the diversity of preferences and lifestyles among men.

The tweet is designed to appeal to the sentimentality of the audience rather than presenting factual information or logical arguments.

6. Appeal to Consequence fallacy:

The other tweets in the campaign do not explicitly use an Engage tactic.,The post by @KyivIndependent uses the Explain tactic by providing details on Russia's military activities. The tweet explains that Moscow has launched Pacific Fleet exercises in hopes to make itself more attractive to China and has raised the Pacific Fleet to the highest level of combat readiness for combat checks. This tweet elaborates on the topic of defense and military by providing specific information about Russia's actions in the Pacific Fleet.,The post by @KyivIndependent that mentions Moscow launching Pacific Fleet exercises in hopes to make itself more attractive to China could be considered an Excite tactic as it may elicit excitement or interest in the reader about military activities and international relations.,"The posts from @KyivIndependent and @AuthorMBTosi are the ones that use an Enhance tactic. The post from @KyivIndependent provides information about Moscow launching Pacific Fleet exercises, enticing the topic-group to continue discussing military readiness and activities. Similarly, the post from @AuthorMBTosi discusses Native Americans rebelling when their homelands were awarded to colonists, which also encourages further discussion on military treaties and conflicts.","The posts that distort the main message of the topic are:

Ambiguity: The tweet from @GRUGCEL contains ambiguous language with redacted information, leading to confusion and potential misinterpretation.
Example: SCP-‚ñà‚ñà Object class: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Containment Procedures: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Description: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàhuge penis ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

2. Ad Hominem: The tweet from @hourly_cookie about the Scovillia Headmaster involves attacking the credibility of the character by highlighting their past failures, which is a form of the Ad Hominem fallacy.
Example: ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter! What matters is that we didn‚Äôt win last time, the time before that, the time before that, the time before that, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

3. False Analogy: The tweet from @GRUGCEL comparing bad SCP authors to a specific scenario involving redacted information creates a false analogy between the two situations and is misleading.
Example: bad SCP authors be like SCP-‚ñà‚ñà Object class: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Containment Procedures: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Description: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàhuge penis ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

4. Equivocation: The repetition of the tweet about Bumbleberry Cookie can be seen as an equivocation fallacy, where the same information is presented multiple times to give the impression of more content or credibility than actually exists.
Example: ""This hours NPC is, Bumbleberry Cookie! 'PSHHH! The first thing every princess needs is STRENGTH!' #cookierun #cookierunkingdom #cookierunovenbreak""

5. Circular Reasoning: The tweet from @hourly_cookie about Toothpaste Cookie involves circular reasoning as it presents a situation where the character dismisses a dramatic boss without providing a valid reason.

10. Appreciation for the show 1899 and comparison with Dark.","1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @midorie2001, who expresses strong emotional attachment to the show ""1899."" This fallacy exists because emotional responses should not be the sole basis for an argument or decision-making. Example: ""I can't watch the show due to how emotionally attached I am to the characters.""

2. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet by @burrrrrberry, who recommends watching ""1899"" and mentions other shows in a similar genre. This fallacy exists because the recommendation is based on tradition or past practices rather than specific qualities of the show. Example: ""If you liked shows like 'Dark,' you'll love '1899' too!""

3. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @percyakr21, who criticizes Netflix for canceling ""1899"" based on its popularity. This fallacy exists because the popularity or success of a show should not be the sole basis for its value or continuation. Example: ""Netflix made a mistake canceling '1899,' it was loved by so many fans.""

4. Bandwagon: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet by @KimFiedler_, who implies that supporting the renewal of ""1899"" is a trend that subscribers should follow. This fallacy exists because joining a popular opinion or movement does not necessarily make it right or justified. Example: ""Join the movement to #Renew1899, everyone else is doing it!""

5. Guilt by Association: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @KimFiedler_, who suggests that Netflix and its subscribers should be held accountable for supporting or not supporting the show ""1899."" This fallacy exists because assigning blame or responsibility based on association is not always fair or logical. Example: ""Netflix must renew '1899,' or they will lose their loyal subscribers.""

6. False Cause: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet by @StarlessMistake, who compares the viewing figures of different shows to predict their cancellation by Netflix. This fallacy exists because correlation does not always imply causation, and there may be other factors at play in the decision to cancel a show. Example: ""Viewing figures for '1899' are declining, so it will likely be canceled soon.""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts suggest a shared interest in and knowledge of specific television shows, particularly ""1899"" and ""Dark"" on Netflix.
