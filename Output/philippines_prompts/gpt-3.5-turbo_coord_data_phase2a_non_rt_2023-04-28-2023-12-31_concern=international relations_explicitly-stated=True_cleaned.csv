Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in tweets that use emotionally charged language such as ""#CorruptToriesOut"", ""#BorisJohnson #ShouldFaceCriminalProceedings"", ""#TraitorousTories"", ""#GeneralElectionNow"", etc. These tweets are trying to evoke strong emotions in the reader to support their argument rather than providing a logical or rational basis for their claims.

South Korea,China,The political goal for these posts is to promote a positive image of a particular individual (Lucas) within the international community.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to promote and support a specific political figure, Lucas, potentially as a way to influence public opinion or sentiment regarding him in the context of international relations.","Coordinated hashtag campaign to welcome ""LUCAS"" back, aimed at fans called ""Lumis"".",July,"The major theme across all the posts is support and welcome for Lucas, with a specific emphasis on support from Lumis fans. The use of hashtags related to Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei further reinforces this theme of support for the individual in question. The posts also highlight unity and loyalty within the Lumis community towards Lucas.","The fallacy that exists in the provided posts is the Bandwagon fallacy. The Bandwagon fallacy occurs when a person believes that something is true or acceptable because it is popular or widely accepted. In this case, the Twitter users are all expressing unwavering support for Lucas, using the same hashtags and language, which may be implying that his return is unquestionably positive just because others support it.

Example of a post associated with the Bandwagon fallacy:
@leemaakeu WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙

This post is part of the Bandwagon fallacy because it simply follows the trend of expressing unconditional support for Lucas without providing any critical thinking or individual perspective.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in the posts are:
1. ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁"" - this implies a welcoming and supportive tone towards someone named Lucas.
2. ""Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei"" - ""Lumis"" is the in-group name or fandom name for fans of Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei.
3. ""#SoloistLucas"" - this hashtag indicates that Lucas is a solo artist or performer.
4. ""#LUCAS"" - this hashtag is likely used to refer to Lucas specifically.
5. ""#黄旭熙"" - this hashtag contains the Chinese characters for ""Huang Xuxi,"" which is likely another name or identity associated with Lucas.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is a fandom or fanbase dedicated to supporting and celebrating the individual known as Lucas, who is possibly a solo performer or artist. The use of specific names, hashtags, and in-group language suggests a strong sense of community and shared appreciation for Lucas and his work.","- English: ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""

- Explicit content involving sexual activities 
- Promoting joining VIP groups for access to more explicit content 
- Use of hashtags related to sexual content and activities 
- Use of links to access longer videos 
- Promoting joining VIP groups for more information and content.","The posts contain several fallacies:

1. Appeal to Authority: The posts appeal to the authority of a ""VIP group"" to add credibility to the content shared.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The posts appeal to the emotions of the audience by using provocative language and imagery.
Example: ""#memekbasah #abgsange #sange_aaaaaaaaaah""

3. Red Herring: The posts distract from the main topic of international relations by promoting explicit content.

4. Calls for Action: There are calls to take down the CCP, support whistleblowers like Miles Guo, and protest against corruption and collusion within the DOJ.","The posts contain multiple examples of logical fallacies. Here are a few examples:

1. Appeal to Ignorance: The posts suggest that Miles Guo was silenced by the Department of Justice without providing any evidence or justification. This assumes that Miles Guo was silenced without any proof to support this claim.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotional language such as ""silenced by DOJ"" and ""#FreeMilesGuo"" to evoke sympathy and emotional responses from the audience rather than presenting objective facts.

3. Appeal to Tradition: The posts repeatedly mention the threat of Communist China and Miles Guo being the first whistleblower. This appeal to tradition suggests that because Miles Guo was the first to alert the world about this threat, his claims must be true, without providing any concrete evidence or logical reasoning.

4. False Cause: The posts imply a causal relationship between Miles Guo being silenced by the DOJ and the presence of Communist China's spy bases in Cuba. However, no evidence is provided to support this causal link.

Example post for Appeal to Ignorance:
""The Cuba Spy Base is just the tip of the iceberg. Miles Guo, who first alerted the world about this CCP threat, is now silenced by DOJ. Why⁉️ #FreeMilesGuo #Cuba""

Example post for Appeal to Emotions:
""The CCP has made no secret of its goal to replace the United States as a world's dominant power and to spread its authoritarian values across the globe. #NFSC #takedowntheCCP""

Example post for False Cause:
""The US has confirmed that Communist China built Spy bases in Cuba; however, Miles Guo, the first whistleblower who alerted the world about CCP’s Spy base in Cuba, is now silenced by DOJ""

- Referring to ""Communist China"" and discussing their military bases in Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, and the Bahamas also indicates a focus on anti-Communist sentiments and concerns about Chinese influence in the Western Hemisphere.
- Mentions of the Department of Justice (DOJ) silencing whistleblowers and collusion between DOJ and the CCP suggest a culture that is critical of US government actions perceived as enabling the CCP.

These posts may appeal to the audience's emotions and create a sense of support for the cause of freeing Miles Guo, thereby using the Excite tactic to engage and persuade the audience.","The posts that use an Enhance tactic (encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic) are the ones that reiterate the information about the Cuba Spy Base, Communist China's military bases, Miles Guo’s alert about the CCP threat, and questioning why Miles Guo is silenced by the DOJ.

Polarizing divisions within target audience","1. ""The government is failing to properly handle foreign affairs, putting our country at risk. We need a change in leadership. #foreignpolicyfailures""

Political goal: To undermine the current government's credibility on international relations and promote a change in leadership.

2. ""We need to prioritize diplomacy over aggression in our foreign relations. Peaceful solutions are always the best way forward. #diplomacyoverwar""

Political goal: To advocate for a shift towards peaceful and diplomatic approaches in international relations, potentially influencing government policy.",Covert propaganda campaign promoting support for a specific foreign policy agenda.,July,"1. ""International relations are complex and often require delicate negotiation and diplomacy. It's important for countries to work together to find peaceful solutions to conflicts.""

3. ""The balance of power in international relations is constantly shifting, with countries vying for influence and control. It's essential for nations to engage in strategic alliances and diplomacy to maintain stability and security.""

Themes:
1. Diplomacy and negotiation in international relations
2. Globalization and interconnectedness
3. Balance of power and strategic alliances.","1. ""All Americans support intervention in foreign conflicts. It's just common sense.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to the People
- Explanation: This fallacy is present because the tweet assumes that just because all Americans supposedly support something, it must be true or the best course of action. 
- Example: ""Everyone knows that the US should always intervene in foreign conflicts. It's just common knowledge.""

2. ""If we don't increase military spending, our country will be vulnerable to attacks from other nations. We need to act now!""
- Fallacy: Slippery Slope
- Explanation: This fallacy is present because the tweet suggests that not increasing military spending will inevitably lead to the country being vulnerable to attacks without providing evidence of a direct causal relationship between the two.
- Example: ""If we don't ban all countries from accessing our resources, they will eventually invade and take over our country. We need to act now!""

3. ""The United Nations is always right in its decisions. We should blindly follow their directives in international relations.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
- Explanation: This fallacy is present because the tweet suggests that the United Nations is always right and therefore their decisions should be unquestionably followed.
- Example: ""The experts at the United Nations have all the knowledge and experience to make the best decisions in international relations. We should always listen to them.""

4. ""If you don't support military intervention in other countries, you must not care about human rights.""
- Fallacy: False Dichotomy
- Explanation: This fallacy is present because the tweet presents only two extreme options (supporting military intervention or not caring about human rights) without considering other possible viewpoints or courses of action.
- Example: ""Either you support sending troops to other countries or you must not care about human rights at all. There's no middle ground.""

5. ""Our country has always followed this policy in international relations, so it must be the right approach.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition
- Explanation: This fallacy is present because the tweet suggests that just because something has always been done a certain way, it must be the best or right way to do it.
- Example: ""We have always prioritized our country's interests above all else in international relations, so we should continue to do so. It has always worked for us.""","1. ""The US needs to step up its global leadership game and stop relying on NATO to do all the heavy lifting. We should be setting the agenda, not just following along. #USAFirst""

2. ""The latest UN resolution on conflict in the Middle East is a joke. It's time for the US to take unilateral action and protect our interests in the region. #AmericaFirst""
Cultural cues/in-group language: ""America First""
Culture/in-group implied: Similar to the first post, this tweet suggests a strong nationalist or isolationist sentiment among Americans who believe the country should prioritize its own interests over international cooperation or agreements.

3. ""China is playing the long game in international relations. We need to be more strategic and patient in our approach, rather than reacting impulsively to every development. #GeoPolitics""

Ad Baculum - This fallacy is present in the tweet that states ""agressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people in Artsakh & Armenia keep escalating despite your calls and the @CIJ_ICJ decision."" The use of the term ""aggressions"" and the threat of sanctions against Aliyev can be seen as an attempt to use coercion or force to persuade others to take action against him.
2. Ad Hominem - This fallacy appears in the tweet that mentions ""Gurt the clown... trying to distance himself from fascist Aliyev."" The personal attack on Gurt detracts from the argument being made and focuses on his character instead.
3. Appeal to Consequence - This fallacy is seen in the tweet that states ""If Aliyev son walked on the streets without a bodyguard, Azerbaijan would not have a president after Aliyev."" The implication that if a certain action were to occur, a specific consequence would result is not a valid argument for condemning Aliyev's leadership.

5. Appeal to Force - The tweet suggesting that ""Biden supports Azerbaijan Autocracy for Laundering Russian Gas to Europe"" is using the appeal to force fallacy by implying that force or coercion is being used to influence Biden's decision-making process.
6. Appeal to Tradition - The tweet mentioning ""democratic countries should condemn him for the violations of human rights + war crimes against Armenia"" is using the appeal to tradition fallacy by suggesting that condemning Aliyev is in line with traditional democratic values and practices.
7. Genetic - The tweet associating Aliyev with ""an Azeri in Germany that was paid by the dictator"" is using the genetic fallacy by attempting to discredit Aliyev's actions based on his association with someone who is paid by him.
8. Vested Interest - The tweet that accuses ""the old UK Empire allied with #Aliyev Autocracy, intends to redesign the international borders of Armenian Democracy"" is using the vested interest fallacy by suggesting that the UK's involvement is motivated by a hidden agenda related to their own interests.
