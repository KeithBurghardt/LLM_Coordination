1. ""Tory corruption is NOT a mistake, it's the Tory way."" - This metaphor likens Tory corruption to a fundamental characteristic or nature of the Tory government, implying that corruption is deeply ingrained in their system.

2. ""The people are sick of your lies, extreme ideology, incompetence & corruption. Tories have run out of ideas & run out of road"" - This metaphor compares the Tory government to a vehicle that has reached the end of its path, suggesting that they have exhausted their strategies and are no longer fit to lead.

3. ""The people of this Country are being taken for a ride."" - This metaphor likens the relationship between politicians and the public to being misled or deceived, emphasizing the lack of transparency and accountability in governance.

4. ""Politicians, Rich profiteering on the backs of the Workers."" - This metaphor compares politicians and the wealthy elite to individuals who exploit and benefit from the labor of working-class people, highlighting the imbalance of power and economic inequality in society.

5. ""Freeport developers deny Tory Corruption Allegation"" - This metaphor suggests that developers are refusing to acknowledge or take responsibility for corrupt practices associated with the Tory government, emphasizing the importance of holding both politicians and their associates accountable for unethical behavior.","Catchphrases explicitly mentioned related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the posts include:

Additionally, the posts call for the release of Miles Guo and Yvette Wang and reference harassment and assassination attempts by CCP agents. Overall, the theme centers around tensions and suspicions surrounding international relations and political espionage.","One fallacy that can be identified in the posts is Appeal to Authority. This fallacy is present in the tweets because they repeatedly mention various politicians and government agencies as though their support or endorsement is proof of the claims being made. For example, the use of hashtags like #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang and #TakeDownTheCCP with the names of politicians and government agencies implies that their support is evidence of the truth of the statements being made.

Here is an example of a post for the Appeal to Authority fallacy:
""@Jim_Jordan We strongly protest the corruption inside the Department of Justice(DOJ), and the collusion between traitors in the DOJ and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)❗️ #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang""

By tagging Jim Jordan and using the hashtag #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvetteWang, the post is appealing to the authority of Jim Jordan to lend credibility to the claims being made regarding the corruption in the DOJ and collusion with the CCP.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts imply an anti-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) group or community. The use of terms like ""traitors in the DOJ"" and calling for the freedom of Miles Guo and Yvette Wang suggest a specific focus on Chinese government corruption and human rights abuses. Additionally, hashtags like #TakeDownTheCCP further reinforce this anti-CCP sentiment. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely one that is critical of the Chinese government and its actions, especially in relation to the United States. This group may prioritize issues related to democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights.","- Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
