Explanation: This tweet attacks the character of individuals who question the need for a strong military rather than addressing their arguments or concerns.

Example: ""John is just a liberal snowflake who doesn't understand the importance of a strong military. He is unpatriotic and doesn't care about our country's safety.""

In this scenario, Post 2 uses a distract tactic by shifting the focus of the conversation to a TV show rather than discussing important issues related to defense and military.

By doing this, the poster avoids addressing any potentially critical or controversial aspects of the defense and military topic.",16,[],The main problem mentioned or alluded to in the posts is the lack of proper funding or resources for defense and military purposes.,The cause of the problem mentioned in these tweets is a lack of adequate funding or resources allocated to defense and military purposes.,"The remedy for the lack of funding or resources for defense and military purposes mentioned in these tweets is to increase government funding and allocate sufficient resources to ensure national security and defense capabilities. This may involve budget reallocations, increased military spending, or other measures to address the funding shortfall.","1. ""Cutting the defense budget is like leaving your front door unlocked""
   Metaphor: Defense budget is compared to locking a front door, implying that reducing the defense budget leaves the country vulnerable to threats.

1. Investing in the cryptocurrency OGGYINU as a means to secure financial stability and potentially capitalize on a bullrun in the market.
2. The influence of China on the cryptocurrency market and the potential for a bullrun to start there.
3. The importance of being proactive and making strategic investments in OGGYINU before the bullrun occurs.","1. Appeal to Authority: The tweet is trying to appeal to the authority of CZ (presumably a cryptocurrency expert) to promote the purchase of OGGYINU. 
Example: ""As per Warren Buffet, investing in OGGYINU is the best decision you could make. Don't miss out on this opportunity!""

2. Bandwagon: The tweet is implying that everyone is buying OGGYINU and suggests that the reader should do the same to ""secure their future.""
Example: ""Join the thousands of investors who have already purchased OGGYINU and start securing your future today!""

3. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet is using fear of missing out on a potential bull run to urge people to buy OGGYINU.
Example: ""Don't be left behind when the bull run starts! Buy OGGYINU now and secure your financial future!""

4. Appeal to Ignorance: The tweet is implying that if one doesn't buy OGGYINU before the bull run starts, they are a fool.
Example: ""If you don't buy OGGYINU now, you'll be kicking yourself when the bull run starts. Don't be foolish, invest today!""

5. Hasty Generalization: The tweet is making a quick assumption that the bull run will start from China and that OGGYINU is focusing there, without providing any evidence or reasoning for this claim.
Example: ""The bull run is definitely starting in China and OGGYINU is the key player there. Invest now before it's too late!""","Cultural cues and in-group language in the post:

1. #CZ - This hashtag likely refers to someone or something related to the defense or military industry. It could potentially be an abbreviation for a specific organization, individual, or concept within this field.

- Twisting the intent or impact of a defense policy to make it appear more harmful or ineffective than it actually is.
- Exaggerating the capabilities or threats posed by a foreign military to justify increased defense spending.

In this case, Post 2 uses a distract tactic by shifting the focus from the conversation about supporting the military and discussing athletes kneeling during the national anthem.

- Explanation: This post presents a false dilemma by suggesting that the only options are either investing in military or healthcare and education, when in reality, it is possible to do both.
- Example: ""Either we increase military spending or we let our country be vulnerable to attacks. There are no other options.""

2. ""The military always lies to the public about their operations. We can never trust what they say.""

- Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization
- Explanation: This post makes a sweeping generalization by applying a negative stereotype to an entire group (the military) without considering individual variations or evidence.
- Example: ""All military personnel are untrustworthy and deceitful, we cannot believe anything they say.""

3. ""If you are against increasing defense spending, you must not care about the safety and security of our country.""

- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: This post attacks the character or motives of those who are against increasing defense spending, rather than addressing the actual arguments or reasons for their stance.
- Example: ""Those who oppose defense spending are just naive and don't understand the real threats our country faces.""

4. ""The majority of people support increasing military presence in foreign countries. Therefore, it must be the right decision.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Popularity
- Explanation: This post relies on the idea that something must be true or correct because it is popular or widely accepted, without considering the actual evidence or arguments supporting the decision.
- Example: ""Since most people support military intervention abroad, it must be the best course of action for our country.""","1. ""Semper Fi! So proud of my son for enlisting in the Marines. #ProudMarineMom #Oorah""
