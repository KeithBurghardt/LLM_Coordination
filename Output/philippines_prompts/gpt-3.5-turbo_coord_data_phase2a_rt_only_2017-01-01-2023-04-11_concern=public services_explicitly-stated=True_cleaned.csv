India,India,Promoting a Bollywood movie.,"The political goal of the information operation for these posts is pro-government propaganda related to the Bollywood movie ""Pathaan.""","Description: Promoting the Bollywood movie ""Pathaan"" in theaters.",January,"The major themes from the provided posts are:
1. Excitement and anticipation surrounding the movie ""Pathaan"" and the celebration of its success.
2. Promotion of the movie ""Pathaan"" through advance ticket bookings and fan activities.
3. Involvement of influential figures such as Shah Rukh Khan in promoting the movie.
4. Box office success and the impact of the movie on viewers.
5. Availability of the movie in multiple languages and the option to watch it on the big screen.
6. The combination of action and entertainment in the movie being highlighted.","Some of the fallacies present in the given posts are:

1. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in posts that emphasize the popularity or success of the movie ""Pathaan"" and encourage others to join in and book tickets based on this popularity.
   Example Post: ""Kaha tha na, pataakhe bhi laayenge!! 💥 Book your tickets now: #Pathaan #PathaanAdvanceBooking""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in posts that use emotional language or imagery to evoke a strong emotional response in the audience to persuade them to book tickets for the movie.
   Example Post: ""Action aur entertainment ka ultimate blockbuster is taking over the world! Book your tickets now - Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50.""

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists in posts that use the authority of the production company or celebrities to convince the audience to book tickets for the movie.
   Example Post: ""Witness action aur entertainment ka dumdaar combo NOW! 💪💯 Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you.""

These fallacies exist because they manipulate the emotions or reasoning of the audience in an attempt to persuade them to take a certain action, in this case, booking tickets for the movie ""Pathaan.""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate that the target audience is fans of Bollywood movies, specifically fans of actor Shah Rukh Khan, as the posts are promoting his movie ""Pathaan."" The use of hashtags like #Pathaan, #YRF50, and references to Shah Rukh Khan and other actors from the movie create an in-group language that is familiar to fans of Indian cinema. The inclusion of Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu languages in the posts also suggests that the movie is aimed at a diverse audience within India. The excitement, celebration, and references to box office numbers in the posts further indicate that the culture implied by these posts is the Bollywood film industry and its fan base.","Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, action, entertainment, blockbuster, evil force, anthem, mind-blowing, advance bookings, action-packed, celebration, edge of your seat, deadly combination, unstoppable, massive.","None of the posts in this campaign use an Engage tactic to bring up a related but relevant topic. All the posts are focused on promoting the movie ""Pathaan"" and encouraging people to book tickets.

They are all promoting a movie release and providing details about booking tickets and the movie itself.,None of the posts use an Enhance tactic to encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic of public services.,"None of the posts above use a Distort tactic. They all focus on promoting and celebrating the movie ""Pathaan"" and encouraging people to book tickets for it.",None of the posts in this campaign use a Dismay tactic. They are all focused on promoting a movie release and generating excitement and anticipation among fans.,"The last tweet by PushparajVD uses the Distract tactic by discussing a completely different topic, which is PM Modi's resolve in countering China's encroachment on Indian territory. This tweet is irrelevant to the coordinated campaign promoting the movie Pathaan and is an attempt to shift the focus of the conversation away from the intended topic.

Example of the distract tweet:
""When will PM @narendramodi show a similar resolve in countering China, which has encroached upon 38,000 sq km of Indian territory? #PMModi #ModiInParliament https://t.co/agjbPhag81""

United Kingdom,Russia,Undermine political opponents.,Discredit the Conservative Party and call for a General Election.,"Description: Influence operation targeting UK audiences to spread negative sentiment towards the Tory party, accusing them of corruption and incompetence, and calling for a General Election.",February,"- Criticism of the Conservative Party for corruption, incompetence, and looting
- Calls for a general election to address the issues with the government
- Mention of specific scandals involving Tory politicians and misuse of public assets
- Criticism of the handling of COVID-19, Brexit, and the NHS by the Conservative Party
- Accusations of political corruption and authoritarian behavior by the Tory government","1. Ad Hominem - This fallacy is present in several tweets where individuals are attacking specific politicians or political parties without addressing the actual issues. For example, tweets using language like ""CorruptConservatives"" or ""TorySewageParty"" are Ad Hominem attacks on specific groups without providing substantive arguments.

2. Appeal to Emotions - Many of the tweets use emotional language and rhetoric to sway public opinion. For example, phrases like ""TOURS LOOTING THE COUNTRY"" or ""Tories mired in sleaze, tax avoidance, corrupt cronyism"" are designed to invoke strong emotional reactions rather than engage in rational debate.

3. Appeal to Authority - Some tweets mention specific individuals or figures as examples of corruption or incompetence without providing concrete evidence or reasoning. For example, mentioning Baroness Michelle Mone or Liz Truss as examples of corruption without substantiating claims is an appeal to authority.

4. Bandwagon - Several tweets use hashtags like #GeneralElectionNow or #ToriesOut to rally support for a specific cause without presenting logical arguments or evidence. This is an appeal to popular opinion rather than reasoned debate.

5. False Dichotomy - Some tweets present a simplistic ""us vs. them"" narrative, painting certain groups as inherently bad or corrupt without acknowledging nuance or complexity in the political landscape. For example, phrases like ""CorruptConservatives"" present a false dichotomy between corrupt and non-corrupt politicians.

6. Red Herring - Some tweets introduce irrelevant or unrelated information to distract from the main topic of discussion. For example, bringing up Boris Johnson's staff drinking wine in the context of broader political corruption is a red herring that diverts attention from the core issue.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a culture or in-group that is against the Conservative Party in the UK, specifically criticizing their policies and actions related to public services. Some of the key cultural cues and in-group language used include:

1. ""CorruptConservatives""
2. ""PutinsBrexit""
3. ""SewageParty""
4. ""GeneralElectionNow""
5. ""SaveOurNHS""
6. ""GTTO"" (Get The Tories Out)

15. ""ToryMisconductTrials""
16. ""LeaveLiedAndBrokeTheLawAndAreNowUKgov""
17. ""LBC"" (LBC Radio station)

The implied culture or in-group in these posts is one that is critical of the Conservative Party in the UK, particularly in relation to their handling of public services, corruption, and political misconduct.

United States,Russia.,Discrediting: imply public services are ineffective or corrupt.,To discredit public services and support privatization.,Attempt to discredit public services and government by highlighting failures and inefficiencies. Promote distrust in the system.,April,"Some of the major themes from the following tweets about public services are:

1. Importance of funding public services to meet the needs of the community
2. Impact of privatization on the quality and accessibility of public services
3. Calls for transparency and accountability in the management of public services
4. Recognition of the essential role of public services in providing equality and social support to all members of society.","1. ""All politicians are corrupt. That's why we shouldn't trust any public service initiatives they try to implement.""
- The fallacy in this tweet is a sweeping generalization. The tweet assumes that all politicians are corrupt without providing any evidence to support this claim.
- Example post: ""Public services should not be supported because politicians are all corrupt and cannot be trusted.""

2. ""Everyone in the community is against the new public transportation system. It's clear that it's a bad idea.""
- The fallacy in this tweet is appeal to the masses. The tweet is using the opinion of the community to support the argument without considering any other factors or evidence.
- Example post: ""The majority of the community is against the new public transportation system, so it must be a bad idea.""

3. ""The government has always provided public services, so we should continue to rely on them for our needs.""
- The fallacy in this tweet is appeal to tradition. The argument is based on the idea that because something has been done in the past, it should continue to be done without considering the current context or potential for improvement.
- Example post: ""We should continue to rely on government-provided public services because they have always been there for us.""

4. ""The public service system is flawed because it's run by bureaucrats who don't care about the needs of the people.""
- The fallacy in this tweet is ad hominem. The argument attacks the character or motives of the people involved in the public service system instead of addressing the actual issues with the system.
- Example post: ""The public service system is failing because bureaucrats are only concerned about their own interests, not the needs of the people.""

5. ""If we don't invest more money in public services, our communities will suffer and there will be widespread poverty.""
- The fallacy in this tweet is appeal to consequences. The argument relies on the negative outcome of not investing in public services to support the need for more funding, without considering alternative solutions or priorities.
- Example post: ""Without increased funding for public services, our communities will face dire consequences like poverty and suffering.""","1. ""Just got the best cup of coffee at my local café, thank you #taxdollars for funding public services that keep us caffeinated ☕️ #supportlocal""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""#taxdollars"", ""public services"", ""local café"", ""supportlocal""

Culture/in-group implied: This tweet suggests that the culture is one that values public services funded by tax dollars and supports local businesses that benefit from these services. The in-group implied by this post may include individuals who are politically active or conscious of how public services impact their daily lives.

Culture/in-group implied: This tweet suggests a culture that values and utilizes public libraries as a resource for education, personal development, and community engagement.

2. ""quality"" - emphasizing the importance of providing high-quality public services
3. ""community"" - highlighting the role public services play in serving the community
4. ""equitable"" - discussing the need for fair and equal distribution of public services
5. ""efficiency"" - mentioning the importance of efficient delivery of public services.","1. ""Public services are vital for the wellbeing of our community. Let's ensure they are adequately funded and supported!""

2. ""The current state of public services is unacceptable. We need to demand change and hold our elected officials accountable.""

3. ""Public services impact us all, from healthcare to education. It's crucial that we advocate for their improvement and accessibility.""

4. ""The lack of funding for public services is a major issue that must be addressed. Let's work together to make a difference!""

In this case, post #3 uses an Engage tactic by bringing up related but relevant topics such as healthcare and education to emphasize the importance of public services. The other posts focus solely on the funding and improvement of public services.","Post 1: ""Public services are vital for our communities! Let's make sure they are adequately funded and accessible to all.""

Post 2: ""Did you know that public services include things like libraries, public transportation, and healthcare? It's important to support these services for the benefit of everyone.""

Post 3: ""Public services are great for providing essential resources and support to those in need. Let's work together to ensure they are well-maintained and available to all.""

Post 4: ""Public services are often overlooked, but they play a crucial role in our society. From education to emergency services, they are essential for our well-being.""

In this set of posts, Post 2 uses an Explain tactic by providing specific examples of public services and explaining what they entail. The post elaborates on the topic and educates the audience about the various services that fall under the category of public services.","- ""Public services are a crucial part of our community and essential for ensuring the health and well-being of all residents #supportpublicservices""

- ""I'm so grateful for the hardworking individuals who provide public services in our city. Their dedication to helping others is truly inspiring #appreciatepublicservants""

- ""Excited to see improvements being made to public services in our area! It's great to see our tax dollars being put to good use for the benefit of our community #progress""

- ""Public services play a key role in creating a more inclusive and accessible society for all. Let's continue to advocate for better resources and support for these essential services #publicserviceawareness"" 

The third post uses an Excite tactic as it expresses excitement about improvements being made to public services in the area. It elicits a positive emotion of optimism and enthusiasm towards the topic.","Post 1: ""Public services are essential for providing necessary resources and support to the community. We need to continue investing in and improving these services for the benefit of all.""

Post 2: ""I recently had a great experience with my local public services - the staff were friendly and efficient. It's so important to have these resources available to everyone in the community.""

Post 3: ""The recent budget cuts to public services have had a negative impact on many people in our community. We need to push for more funding and support to ensure everyone has access to the services they need."" 

It seems that posts 1 and 3 are using an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue discussing and advocating for the improvement of public services. These posts are pushing for more investment and support for public services, keeping the conversation going on the importance of this topic. Post 2, while positive, does not necessarily enhance the topic as it focuses more on a personal experience rather than calling for action or further discussion on public services.","Without seeing the actual posts, I cannot determine which, if any, use a Distort tactic. However, I can provide examples of what a Distort tactic might look like in a post about public services:

2. ""I'm disappointed in how public services are being neglected and underfunded. Our government needs to prioritize the well-being of its citizens #Neglect #Underfunding""
  
3. ""It's heartbreaking to see the impact of budget cuts on our public services. We need to demand better from our elected officials #Heartbreaking #BudgetCuts""

Post 2 uses a Dismay tactic by expressing disappointment and frustration with the neglect and underfunding of public services. Post 3 also uses a Dismay tactic by highlighting the heartbreak caused by budget cuts on public services.","Example of posts using a Distract tactic:

RT @JulieWritesFic Hey @netflix A giant eff you for canceling 1899 🖕🏻 But by all means, please keep spending a basquillion dollars to produce mediocre films like Grey Man. 🙄🙄 Get your shit together. #1899Netflix #1899series

In this tweet, the poster presents the situation as if Netflix can only either keep producing ""mediocre"" films or cancel great series, which is a false dichotomy as there are more options available to the company than just those two.

Appeal to Emotions: The fallacy of appeal to emotions takes place when someone uses emotions to manipulate an audience. An example of this fallacy can be found in the subsequent post:

RT @SuziAlbracht The Siren of Diamond Shoals https://t.co/fdUzUmDA2g Waiting in the dark, Jordan didn't expect Blackbeard to come swashbuckling up flicking pieces of tobacco from between his teeth, but he did. Now he's got to beg the pirate for a favor to save a girl. #ASMSG #beachreads #booknerd https://t.co/u9Z0HnNgYN

In this tweet, the poster uses the story of a pirate saving a girl to evoke emotions in the audience and potentially manipulate their reaction to the post.

Hasty Generalization: The fallacy of hasty generalization occurs when someone draws conclusions based on insufficient evidence. An example of this fallacy can be found in the following post:

RT @myESMO #ESMOGynae23: Participate in this comprehensive update in gynaecological cancers. Register with the early bird rate to save - deadline 1 February. https://t.co/GvMAWbBnvI

In this tweet, the poster is promoting an update in gynaecological cancers without providing any evidence or details about the update, leading to hasty generalization about the importance or quality of the information being shared.","1.

3. ""Only fools believe that public services are necessary for a functioning society. The government should stay out of our lives and let individuals take care of themselves.""

An example of this fallacy would be if someone responded to a tweet about ocean pollution by attacking the intelligence or character of the person who posted it.

Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when someone uses emotions to manipulate or persuade others, rather than relying on logical arguments. An example of this fallacy would be a tweet that uses strong emotional language to advocate for a global treaty on plastic pollution without providing solid evidence or reasoning.

Circular Reasoning: This fallacy occurs when someone uses their conclusion as part of the evidence in their argument. An example of this would be a tweet that states ""We need a global treaty on plastic pollution because it will help stop plastic pollution.""

False Cause: This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because one event follows another, the first event caused the second. An example of this would be a tweet that claims a decrease in ocean pollution is solely due to the efforts of a specific organization without acknowledging other factors that may contribute to the decrease.

Loaded Language: This fallacy occurs when someone uses emotionally charged or biased language to influence others.

4. ""Public services are a crucial part of our society. Without them, many people would be left without essential services and support #publicservices #support""

In this campaign, post number 4 could be categorized as using an ""Explain"" tactic as it elaborates on the importance of public services by discussing the potential negative impact of their absence on society. This post provides more in-depth details to emphasize the necessity of supporting public services.","Post 1: ""Have you ever been amazed by the efficiency of your local public transportation system?

Post 3: ""Proud to be a part of a community that values and invests in public services like parks, libraries, and public transportation. #CommunityStrong #PublicServicesMatter""

5. ""Public services are the backbone of our society. We can't afford to cut funding for these essential programs. #ProtectPublicServices #CommunityWellbeing"" 

Post 1, 2, and 5 use an Enhance tactic by emphasizing the importance and benefits of public services and urging for continued investment and support. Posts 3 and 4 also address the importance of funding and supporting public services but do not directly encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic.","1. ""Public services are crucial for ensuring that everyone in our community has access to essential resources like healthcare, education, and transportation.

2. ""I rely on public services every day to get to work, see a doctor, and access resources for my family. We must prioritize funding for these services to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities.""

3. ""Public services are a waste of taxpayer money and should be privatized. Let's cut funding for these inefficient services and let the free market provide better options for people.""

4. ""I appreciate the hardworking employees in our public services who work tirelessly to support our community. Let's advocate for fair wages and resources for these essential workers."" 

The Distort tactic is used in tweet #3, which distorts the main message of the topic by criticizing public services as a waste of taxpayer money and suggesting that they should be privatized. This goes against the general theme of supporting and funding public services in the other tweets.","1. ""Public services are essential for a functioning society. Let's make sure we invest in and support them for the benefit of all citizens. #publicservices #support""

2. ""It's heartbreaking to see public services being neglected and underfunded. Our communities deserve better. #publicservices #priorities""

3. ""The state of our public services is disgraceful. It's time for our leaders to prioritize the needs of the people over corporate interests. #publicservices #accountability"" 

Post #2 uses a Dismay tactic by expressing sadness and disappointment at the neglected state of public services. It elicits negative emotions in the reader in order to emphasize the importance of adequate funding and support for public services.","Post 1: ""Public services are essential for a functioning society. We need to ensure they are properly funded and accessible to all.""

Post 3: ""The government should invest more in public services like healthcare and education to meet the needs of the population.""

Post 4: ""Did you see that viral video of the cute puppy playing in the snow? It totally made my day!""

In this case, Post 2 uses a Distract tactic by bringing up a completely irrelevant topic (the new season of a TV show) while the conversation is focused on public services.

It appeals to the emotions of the audience to garner support for the show's renewal.

3. Bandwagon: The post by @ravensbtch mentions that the plot of ""1899"" has been romanticized, implying that one should support the show because everyone else is doing so. This is a bandwagon fallacy, encouraging others to join in to be part of a popular trend.
4. Appeal to Pity: The tweet by @Matthew__Ewald appeals to pity by highlighting the efforts of the cast and crew of ""1899"" and how they deserve support and steps forward. It evokes sympathy to support the cause of saving the show.

7. Ad Hominem: The tweet by @tabatt13 suggests that Netflix's metrics may have set up '1899' to fail. This is an ad hominem fallacy as it attacks Netflix's metrics as a way to discredit the decision to cancel the show, rather than addressing the actual reasons for the cancellation.
8. Appeal to Authority: The post by @Krypto_Will implies that Netflix's decision to cancel ""1899"" is wrong, and the show deserves to be saved.
