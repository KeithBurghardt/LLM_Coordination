to sexual activities and the exploitation of young individuals for financial gain. This behavior can contribute to the perpetuation of dangerous and harmful social norms, as well as potentially criminal activities.","The cause of the problem stated in these tweets is the proliferation of online platforms and social media where individuals can easily share explicit and inappropriate content, including videos of sexual activities involving young individuals. These platforms may not have sufficient measures in place to prevent or remove such content, leading to its widespread promotion and dissemination for financial gain. The desire for financial profit and the lack of strict regulations or oversight on online platforms contribute to the exploitation of young individuals and the perpetuation of harmful societal norms regarding sexual activities.","The remedy for the problem mentioned in these tweets is the implementation of stricter regulations and oversight on online platforms and social media to prevent the promotion and dissemination of explicit and inappropriate content related to sexual activities, especially involving young individuals. This can include measures such as age verification, content moderation, and reporting tools to quickly remove such content. Additionally, enforcement of laws against the exploitation of young individuals for financial gain, as well as raising awareness about the harmful effects of such behavior, can help address the issue and protect vulnerable individuals from being exploited.","Metaphors related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets:

Problem:
1. Promoting explicit content: Using phrases such as ""memek basah"" (wet vagina) and ""bahancoli"" (masturbation material) to attract viewers to explicit videos.

2. Lack of regulations: Implying the lack of age verification and content moderation on online platforms with phrases like ""join VIP grup Info"" and ""vcsreal"" (real video call services).

Remedy:
1. Implementation of stricter regulations: Suggesting the need for age verification and content moderation with phrases like ""enforcement of laws"" and ""reporting tools"" to prevent the promotion of inappropriate content.
2. Raising awareness: Mentions of ""protecting vulnerable individuals"" and ""raising awareness"" to address the harmful effects of online exploitation and promote safer online environments.","Catchphrases related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets include:

The global economy is about to collapse and this marxist stuff is still the priority."" This fallacy appeals to the emotions of the audience by suggesting that the UN is prioritizing ""identity politics nonsense"" over more pressing issues like the global economy collapsing.

Ad Hominem: This fallacy can be found in the tweet from @CollinRugg which states ""When one party is constantly faced with indictments and arrests while the other never faces any consequences, you don't live in a democracy. You live under authoritarian rule."" This fallacy is attacking a specific political party rather than addressing the actual issue of indictments and arrests.

Appeal to Fear: This fallacy is present in the tweet from @promisingzhuang which quotes FM Qingang stating ""Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the inviolable duty of all Chinese ppl, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.""

Anecdotal Evidence: This fallacy can be found in the tweet from @patriotmary4 which states ""Kari Lake Says ‘Powerful People’ Recently Tried to Bribe Her to Leave Politics."" This anecdotal account of a bribery attempt is presented as evidence of corruption without any further verification or context.

Post Hoc: This fallacy is present in the tweet from @liz_churchill8 which states ""the WHO Treaty finalizes in 2024…they will need to have the right President in place…enforce severe censorship…and then they will release the next Pandemic."" This fallacy suggests a causal relationship between the finalization of the WHO Treaty and the release of the next pandemic, without providing any evidence to support this claim.","1.

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to support their argument by citing an authority figure rather than presenting valid evidence.

1. Bandwagon fallacy: ""#Marcos 😍 #MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023"" - This post uses popular hashtags and emojis related to Marcos to imply that supporting him is the popular and correct choice without providing any substantial argumentation.
2. Appeal to Emotions: ""RT @quepasaprimoo Omg Marcos hi https://t.co/9JUv6ClIB1"" - This tweet uses emotional language (""Omg"") and a casual greeting (""hi Marcos"") to evoke emotional responses from the audience rather than engaging in a rational discussion.
3. Appeal to Authority: ""RT @Vero27abril #Marcos 😍 #MarcosGH23 #GranHermano #GH2022 #GH2023 https://t.co/LKnLeU8EMe"" - This post cites a specific user (@Vero27abril) as a source of information and repeatedly mentions their opinions to lend authority to the arguments presented without providing valid evidence.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts are hashtags such as #Marcos, #MarcosGH23, #GranHermano, #GH2022, and #GH2023.

8. Urging followers not to be fooled and to take action before the bullrun starts.","The following post contains the fallacy of Appeal to Emotions. The post appeals to the emotions of fear and urgency to persuade individuals to buy a specific cryptocurrency in order to secure their future before the bull run starts. 

Example Post: 
@CryptoThro As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts

The following post contains the fallacy of Ad Populum, where the argument is made appealing to the popularity of the statement without providing any actual evidence or reasoning behind the claim.

Armenia,Armenia.,"The political goal for the posts is to highlight human rights violations, advocate for international intervention, and expose corruption in the Azerbaijani government under Aliyev.","The political goal of the information operation is to portray Azerbaijani President Aliyev as a genocidal and despotic dictator, highlighting human rights violations and calling for international sanctions and action against him.",Propaganda operation promoting Armenian interests in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.,There isn't enough information to determine the starting month of the information operation for the posts provided.,"The major themes from these posts include:
1. Concerns about the existence of a Defense Army in NagornoKarabakh to prevent ethnic cleansing by Aliyev and the Azerbaijani military.
2. Criticism of Aliyev for violating ceasefires, attacking Armenians in NagornoKarabakh, and maintaining a blockade in the Lachin Corridor.
3. Calls for international pressure and action against Aliyev to end the humanitarian crisis and release political prisoners.
4. Reports of human rights abuses and violence by police in Azerbaijan, raising concerns about the treatment of Armenians in the country.
5. Accusations of propaganda, disinformation, and brutality by the Aliyev regime, as well as comparisons to other authoritarian leaders.
6. Critiques of international inaction and calls for sanctions against Aliyev for escalating aggression against Armenians.
7. References to corruption in Azerbaijan, concerns about autocracy and authoritarianism under Aliyev, and suggestions of ethnic cleansing.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets strongly appeal to emotions by using words like ""ethnically cleansed,"" ""genocidal,"" ""terrorist,"" and ""barbarism"" to evoke fear, anger, and a sense of urgency in the reader. This fallacy exists because the arguments are based on emotion rather than logical reasoning.

Example post: ""Azerbaijan violated the ceasefire in Nagorno Karabakh. Now the world knows what Aliyev means.""

2. Ad Hominem: Some tweets attack Aliyev personally, calling him a ""terrorist,"" ""despotic,"" and linking him to Saddam Hussein. This fallacy exists because the focus is on attacking the character of Aliyev rather than addressing the actual social and economic issues at hand.

Example post: ""Aliyev, in 2023, increasingly looks and sounds like Saddam Hussein circa 1990.""

3. Appeal to Authority: Some tweets appeal to the authority of international figures like Macron, Merkel, and the UN to call for action against Aliyev. This fallacy exists because the argument relies on the authority of these figures rather than presenting sound evidence or reasoning.

Example post: ""Words won’t stop Aliyev @EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @CharlesMichel @POTUS @vonderleyen @SecBlinken @UN @JosepBorrell 120000 Armenians from Artsakh have been under blockade for 36 days. This is war against civilians.""

4. Poisoning the Well: Some tweets attempt to discredit Aliyev by accusing him of paying people to tweet in his favor or spreading disinformation. This fallacy exists because it undermines Aliyev's credibility before presenting any concrete evidence or arguments.

Example post: ""@Azeri_Mamedov @mizzvelouria @presidentaz So you confirm that #Aliyev is paying you to tweet like a crow on twitter.""

Overall, these tweets are filled with fallacies that detract from the actual social and economic issues being discussed and rely heavily on emotion, personal attacks, appeals to authority, and attempts to discredit the opposing side.","Cultural cues or in-group language:

- The existence of a Defense Army in Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh is crucial to prevent ethnic cleansing by the Aliyev regime.
- Maximum pressure should be placed on Aliyev to end the blockade of the Lachin Corridor to prevent a humanitarian crisis.
- Calls for the release of political prisoners and action against human rights abuses by the Aliyev regime.
- International condemnation and sanctions are needed to address the actions and behavior of the Aliyev regime.

Remedy:
- The international community should intervene to open the Lachin Corridor and stop the blockade and aggression against civilians.
- Aliyev should release all political prisoners and respect human rights.
- Sanctions should be imposed on Aliyev to uphold democracy and protect the Armenian population.
- Maximum pressure should be put on Aliyev to end the blockade and prevent further humanitarian crises.",

6. The role of Christian Nationalism in promoting oppression and authoritarianism","1. Appeal to Emotion: This fallacy exists in the post by @davidiblatt because it uses emotional language to evoke feelings of failure and excessive use regarding oil, coal, and gas creating environmental issues.
Example: ""Oil, coal and gas 'from the ground' has created great success but our excessive use is a failure 'on the ground in air and water'. They should have to clean it up. @Greenpeace #PlasticPollution #Enough #bigoil""

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists in the post by @GreenpeaceNZ because it relies on the authority of Greenpeace to emphasize the importance of the UN Ocean Treaty talks.
Example: ""Greenpeace: 'Why the treaty is important is it will force us to behave right, and to save this great ally that we have called the ocean — the one ocean on this blue planet that can save us.' #ProtectTheOceans""

3. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in the post by @Mahsamoulavi because it implies that negotiations on a Global Plastics Treaty are necessary and underway, and that everyone should be supportive.
Example: ""Negotiations on a Global Plastics Treaty Get Underway | News | SDG Knowledge Hub | IISD - IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub #ESG #sustainabledevelopment #Risk #GlobalGoals #GenderEquality""

4. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy exists in the post by @Sharonsmall56 because it appeals to the fact that World leaders are meeting about a Global Plastics Treaty and implies that supporting it is the popular choice.
Example: ""You can clean a beach – but the plastic always comes back. Securing a Global #PlasticsTreaty at the UN can help us stop #PlasticPollution once and for all 🙅 World leaders meet this fall.

The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a culture or in-group of environmental activists and advocates for marine conservation. Terms such as ""Marine Scientist,"" ""Marine Ecosystems,"" ""PlasticsTreaty,"" ""PlasticPollution,"" ""Global Plastics Treaty,"" ""ocean climate resilience,"" ""High Seas Treaty,"" and references to Greenpeace all point to a group that is focused on protecting the environment, specifically marine life and oceans. The use of emojis, hashtags, and calls to action indicate an online community of individuals who are passionate about addressing social and economic issues related to environmental degradation.

2. In addition, the mention of the UN, international treaties, and global meetings suggests that this group is engaged in advocacy at an international level, working to influence policies and decisions on a global scale. The reference to government leaders, world leaders, and the Communist Party's elite gathering also indicates a broader focus on systemic change and policy-making in the realm of social and economic issues related to the environment.

3. Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is dedicated to environmental activism, advocating for the protection of marine life and oceans, and working towards policy change to address issues such as plastic pollution and climate resilience. They are likely to be well-informed on environmental issues, engage in advocacy efforts, and collaborate with organizations like Greenpeace to drive positive change on a global scale.","- MarineScientist

Appeal to Authority: The posts are implying that because influential figures such as CZ from Binance are involved with the project, it must be a good investment.

Germany,Germany.,"The type of political goal for the posts is to advocate for the renewal and saving of the show ""1899"" on Netflix.","The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to pressure Netflix or other parties to renew/cancel the show 1899, showing support for the continuation of the series.","Description: Campaign to renew the show ""1899"" on Netflix.",September,"1. Frustration and disappointment over the cancellation of the show ""1899"" by Netflix.
2. Advocacy for the renewal and saving of the show ""1899"" through hashtags such as #Save1899 and #Renew1899.
3. Criticism towards Netflix for canceling shows prematurely and not giving them a chance to build an audience.
4. Appreciation for the diversity and language used in the show ""1899.""
5. Comparisons between ""1899"" and other popular shows such as ""Dark.""
6. Desire for interviews with the cast of ""1899"" to better understand the plot.
7. Hope that ""1899"" can continue in some form to give closure to fans and creators.
8. Emotional reactions to the cancellation of ""1899"" and the impact it had on viewers.","Confirmation Bias: The tweets that express disappointment and frustration over the cancellation of the show ""1899"" by Netflix could be seen as confirmation bias. The individuals posting these tweets are looking for evidence to confirm their belief that the show was worth saving, and they are selectively focusing on information that supports their view.

Example:
RT @johnholowach So you cancelled 1899, @netflix? Imagine if Netflix got Breaking Bad, it would have gotten axed after the first season because the audience numbers weren't there in that 28 day window they covet. Clowns.

Ad Populum: The tweets that appeal to the popularity and success of the show ""1899"" in an attempt to pressure Netflix into renewing it could be seen as an appeal to popularity fallacy.

Example:
RT @LilyCrussell @netflix Speaking of languages, #1899 has a ship ton. #save1899 #renew1899

Ad Hominem: The tweet that criticizes Netflix for its handling of sci-fi shows and implies that they are disrespecting the creators and fans of these series could be seen as an ad hominem attack.

Example:
RT @consultingblord Sci-fi has lost, time and time again, within Netflix. So many great series, left there unfinished. 1899 is just the nail on the coffin. Sci-fi creators deserve better! They're doing what no one else is, honestly. #save1899 #renew1899 #1899netflix

Appeal to Emotions: The tweets that express emotional distress over the cancellation of ""1899"" and call for its renewal based on sentiment rather than logical arguments could be seen as an appeal to emotions fallacy.

Example:
RT @ari_oknel @netflix I wanted to sit back and enjoy the second season of 1899. But you cancelled it. Now there’s nothing for me to enjoy, #Netflix #save1899 #1899Netflix https://t.co/2C1JLoGEst","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts indicate a fan base or community centered around the TV show ""1899"" and the campaign to save it from cancellation. The hashtags #1899Netflix, #save1899, and #renew1899 are repeated throughout the tweets, as well as references to the show's plot and characters.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one of passionate fans who are disappointed by the cancellation of a favorite show and are united in their efforts to urge the streaming platform (Netflix) to reconsider. The use of terms like ""marathon,"" ""season 3,"" and references to other sci-fi shows like ""Dark"" suggest a group of viewers who are familiar with and enjoy similar content.

Brazil,Brazil,Influence public opinion or perception.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to manipulate online voting in favor of a specific candidate (#RM) for the Artista Asiatico category at the SECAwards.,Coordinated voting campaign for #RM at #SECAwards with multiple accounts.,June,"The major themes from the posts are:
1. Voting for RM for Artista Asiatico at the SECAwards
2. Use of hashtags and mentions to show support for RM and nominate him for the award
3. Mentioning Marcos in the tweets as a way to show support for RM
4. Possible involvement of multiple users in supporting RM for the award
5. Reference to the 2023 SECAwards","1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy exists in tweets where the user repeatedly mentions Marcos in combination with the voting hashtag for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards, implying that because others are voting for Marcos, the user should also do so. Example tweet: @knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos.

2. Ad Populum Fallacy: This fallacy is present in tweets where the user appeals to the masses by mentioning a large number of users supporting Marcos for the award. Example tweet: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos.

3. Appeal to Authority Fallacy: This fallacy can be seen in tweets where the user references specific users or groups of users (such as @knj_brasil) as authorities or influencers in the voting process. Example tweet: @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos. 

4. Ad Hominem Fallacy: This fallacy is present in tweets where the user includes personal attacks or irrelevant information about other users (e.g., calling out specific users like @KOOKSCHXSE) in an attempt to discredit their voting choices. Example tweet: @knj_brasil @KOOKSCHXSE @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos.

5. Circular Reasoning Fallacy: This fallacy can be seen in tweets where the user provides circular reasoning without offering any valid justification for their voting choice. Example tweet: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts are related to the K-pop fandom, specifically fans of the artist RM from the group BTS.

The repetition of the hashtag #SECAwards and the mention of Marcos in some of the tweets suggests a specific event or award ceremony where fans are showing their support for RM.

Students may feel pressured to perform well in their sport in order to secure a college scholarship, leading to intense competition and stress. Colleges and universities may also put pressure on athletes to commit to their programs, creating a competitive and sometimes cutthroat recruiting process.","The remedy for the problem of high-pressure college recruitment of high school athletes on National Signing Day is for colleges and universities to prioritize the well-being and mental health of student-athletes. This could involve implementing policies and practices that reduce stress and competition in the recruiting process, providing resources for athletes to cope with pressure, and promoting a more balanced approach to sports and academics. Additionally, creating a more transparent and supportive environment for student-athletes during the recruiting process can help alleviate some of the negative impacts of the high-pressure recruiting culture.","There are no explicit metaphors related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets provided.

8. US military presence in Asia countering Beijing
9. Future of European integration process
10. China's approach to global manufacturing chain and Zero-COVID
11. Democratic regimes imposing sanctions on China for human rights violations","1. Appeal to Authority:
Post: ""The U.S. is expanding its military presence in Asia, in a string of moves aimed at countering Beijing and reassuring Indo-Pacific allies that America will stand with them against threats from China and North Korea.""
Explanation: The post appeals to the authority of the U.S. government as a source of information and guidance on the military presence in Asia.

2. Appeal to Emotions:
Post: ""To keep the growing exposure of gross #humanrights violations under check, #CCP used its worldwide 'police stations' under the garb of citizen service centres to monitor, intimidate, arrest, and even repatriate #Uyghurs.""
Explanation: The post uses language that evokes emotional responses by highlighting human rights violations and the plight of the Uyghur population.

3. Appeal to Consequence:
Post: ""Democratic regimes must continue to impose #sanctions and show more sincerity in scrutinising, exposing, and punishing #China’s genocide of its #Muslim minorities.""
Explanation: The post argues that democratic regimes should take action against China for its treatment of Muslim minorities by emphasizing the consequences of not doing so.

4. Generalization:
Post: ""According to #China, #India is different from Vietnam or Bangladesh, who are content with just strengthening their production and processing bases; but India wants more, it wants to grab the entire #valuechain from China.""
Explanation: The post makes a generalization about China's perspective on India's intentions in terms of the value chain.

5. False Dichotomy:
Post: ""The oil deal could be a fundamental test for the future of #Afghanistan-#China cooperation.""
Explanation: The post presents a false dichotomy by implying that the outcome of the oil deal could determine the entire future of cooperation between Afghanistan and China.

Post: ""While #India has been the third-highest #military spender after US & #China since 2020, both those countries have such a lead over India in #defence spending & armed forces modernisation that India is left with stark options.""
Explanation: The post indirectly attacks India by comparing its military spending to that of the US and China and suggesting that India is at a disadvantage.

7. False Equivalence:
Post: ""Stuart Rollo explores the dangers of #tech-utopianism by examining its influence on international #security dynamics and the emergence of economic and military tech-rivalry between the United States and #China.""
Explanation: The post equates the influence of tech-utopianism on security dynamics between the United States and China, suggesting a false equivalence in their approaches to technology.
