Appeal to Emotions: The fallacy of appeal to emotions occurs when someone uses emotions to manipulate or persuade someone instead of using valid arguments. In this case, the tweets are trying to evoke emotions of support for Lucas without presenting any logical arguments.

Example post: ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""

2. Bandwagon: The bandwagon fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or widely accepted, it must be true or good. In this case, the tweets are trying to create a sense of belonging and support by jumping on the bandwagon of supporting Lucas.

Example post: ""GANAMOOOOS Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is better or correct because it has always been done that way. In this case, the tweets are appealing to the tradition of supporting Lucas without providing any logical justification.

Example post: ""Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts imply that the culture or in-group is related to fans of a K-pop artist named Lucas, also known by his full name Huang Xuxi and stage name Wong Yukhei.

These posts show the strong support and loyalty of the fans towards Lucas/Lumis, and how they come together to welcome him back after some situation (in this case, the implied return from a hiatus).

Ad Hominem: The tweet by @QbccSecrets contains an Abusive Ad Hominem fallacy as they attack Health Minister Shannon Fentiman without addressing the actual issue at hand.
Example: ""Shannon Fentiman is a terrible Health Minister and a corrupt individual. She should resign immediately.""

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet by @JGademski uses the emotion of fear to suggest that Victorians will face a Treaty Reparations Tax without any substantial evidence or reasoning.
Example: ""Victorians, get ready for higher taxes! The corrupt government is coming for your money through the Treaty Reparations Tax!""

3. Ad Populum: The tweet by @LT_Aust appeals to the masses by using the corruption allegation against Dan Andrews to discredit the entire Labor party.
Example: ""The corrupt Dan Andrews Govt is stealing money, and nothing is being done. This just shows the wider corruption in the Labor party.""

4. Straw Man: The tweet by @Rob_Roos presents a distorted and exaggerated version of the WHO's intentions with the Global Pandemic Treaty to make it seem like a threat to freedom and democracy when it may not be the case.
Example: ""The WHO's Global Pandemic Treaty will endanger our freedom and democracy! We must stop this power grab before it's too late.""

5. False Equivalence: The tweet by @LauraLoomer draws a false equivalence between the current situation in the United States and third world countries without providing substantive evidence.

Criticism of Pierre Poilievre and the CPC's rhetoric and actions.
2. Concerns about foreign interference in Canadian politics.
3. Accusations of election fraud and cheating by the CPC.
4. Comparison of Poilievre to Trump and concerns about authoritarianism.
5. Calls for accountability and transparency in political reporting and decision-making.
6. Disapproval of CPC leadership and tactics.
7. Support for freedom of expression and opposition to censorship.
8. Criticism of conservative politicians and their alleged connections to racist figures.
9. Concerns about national security and relationships with foreign countries.
10. Criticism of media bias in favor of the CPC.","Appeal to Emotions - The first post suggests that the majority of Canadians who are progressives do not buy into the hate and rage promoted by Poilievre and the CPC. This appeals to emotions by framing the issue as a battle between good and evil.

Name Calling - The second post uses derogatory hashtags like #FreeDumbFuckers, #TrumpTreason, and #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou to attack Poilievre and the CPC. This is an example of name-calling, which is a form of ad hominem fallacy.

Ad Ignorantiam - The third post implies that a Chinese company linked to Cuba spy is somehow involved in Trump administration. This is an appeal to ignorance fallacy as it assumes a link without providing any evidence.

Ad Hominem - The fourth post accuses the CPC of election fraud and cheating without providing any substantial evidence. This is an example of an ad hominem attack.

Ad Verecundiam - The fifth post dismisses media reports as being sensationalist and claims that information on Chinese interference can only come from secret reports. This is an appeal to an unqualified authority or appeal to an authority fallacy.

Ad Hominem - The sixth post accuses Poilievre of using national security as a political tool and compares him to a domestic terrorist. This is an example of an ad hominem attack.

Ad Hominem - The seventh post dismisses calls for Mendicino to resign based on the political leanings of those making the claims. This is another example of an ad hominem argument.

False Cause - The eighth post implies that conservative media is responsible for promoting false information about Mendicino. This is a false cause fallacy as it assumes a causal relationship without evidence.

Ad Hominem - The ninth post compares Poilievre to Trump and accuses him of behaving in a Trumpian way. This is a form of ad hominem attack.

Overall, these posts contain various fallacies such as appeals to emotions, ad hominem attacks, appeal to ignorance, appeal to authority, and false cause fallacies. These fallacies exist in the posts to manipulate the reader's emotions, distract from the actual topic, or discredit the opposition without providing solid evidence or reasoning.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts suggest that the culture or in-group implied is that of progressive Canadians who are critical of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members.

5. Espionage and surveillance","1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts are using emotionally charged language to evoke fear and concern about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the situation surrounding Miles Guo being silenced by the DOJ.
Example: ""Imagine how many CCP spy’s are inside America blackmailing our corrupt politicians into doing their bidding! Miles Guo could expose them all! We must #FreeMilesGuo""

2. Appeal to Force: There is a sense of urgency and threat implied in the posts, suggesting that action must be taken immediately to combat the CCP's influence.
Example: ""The CCP state actors orchestrate astroturfing in order to instigate division, and manipulate public opinions among the Chinese diaspora, and undermine democracy, interfere with other countries internal affairs. #FreeMilesGuo #FreeYvatteWang""

3. Appeal to Tradition: There is a call to uphold traditional values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law as a way to combat the CCP threat.
Example: ""PEOPLE must uphold the rights of the Chinese people to seek & fight for democracy, freedom & the rule of law""

4. Bandwagon: The posts suggest that many people are involved in the movement to support Miles Guo and take down the CCP, implying that joining in is the popular or right thing to do.
Example: ""The western world must do 3 things to save themselves from the CCP""

5. False Cause: There is a correlation made between Miles Guo being silenced by the DOJ and the supposed threat of the CCP's spy bases, but there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship between the two.
Example: ""The Cuba Spy Base is just the tip of the iceberg. Communist China deployed several military bases in Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, the Bahamas, and more. Miles Guo, who first alerted the world about this CCP threat is now silenced by DOJ. Why?""

6. Hasty Generalization: The posts make sweeping statements about the influence of the CCP on politicians and institutions in the US without providing specific evidence.
Example: ""Both Republicans and Democrats in the US are mostly influenced by the Chinese Communist Party. Our American justice system has broken, and Miles Guo is paying the consequence of that""

7. Straw Man: There is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the situation involving Miles Guo as a way to garner support for his cause.
Example: ""Both Republicans and Democrats in the US are mostly influenced by the Chinese Communist Party. Our American justice system has broken, and Miles Guo is paying the consequence of that, and that's why I'm running for Congress and fighting for people like Miles Guo.""

China,China,Promoting cryptocurrency investment as a way to secure a financial future.,"The political goal of the information operation in these posts is to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and encourage people to buy it before a supposed bull run starts, potentially leading to financial gain through deception.","Coordinated influence operation promoting the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU as a future investment during the bullrun, targeting specific influencers and amplifying the message across Twitter.",There is no indication of any criminal activity in the provided posts.,"The major themes from these posts are cryptocurrency investment advice, potential scams or schemes, and the promotion of a specific cryptocurrency called #OGGYINU. These posts suggest that the cryptocurrency market will experience a bullrun starting in China and encourage followers to buy #OGGY as a way to secure their future and potentially profit from the market movements. The repeated emphasis on not being fooled and securing one's future before the bullrun starts may imply a sense of urgency or potential risk in missing out on investment opportunities.","1. Appeal to Authority fallacy - The posts are appealing to the authority of CZ, the founder of Binance, to promote the cryptocurrency OGGYINU. This fallacy exists because just because CZ says something does not necessarily make it true or a guarantee of success in the crypto market.
Example: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

2. Bandwagon fallacy - The posts are trying to create a sense of urgency and imply that everyone is buying OGGYINU, so you should too to avoid missing out on potential profits. This fallacy exists because the decision to invest in a cryptocurrency should be based on thorough research and analysis, not on following the crowd.
Example: ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

3. Appeal to Emotions fallacy - The posts use emotive language like ""Don't be fool"" and ""secure your future"" to appeal to people's emotions and fear of missing out. This fallacy exists because it manipulates the reader's emotions rather than presenting factual information.
Example: ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

Overall, these posts rely on fallacies to persuade people to invest in OGGYINU without providing any substantial evidence or reasoning for why it would be a good investment.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in the posts include references to #CZ, #OGGYINU, and the concept of a ""bullrun"" starting from China. The culture or in-group implied by these posts appears to be related to cryptocurrency trading and investment.

1. Ad Hominem- Circumstantial: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @ianaavanesian, where the nature of Ilham Aliyev's actions is criticized based on his behavior rather than the actual content of his actions.

2. Appeal to Force: It is evident in the tweet by @raffiniziblian, where the suggestion of using sanctions to pressure Aliyev into a potential peace treaty is made.

3. Poisoning the Well: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @Armenia_Better, where the negative portrayal of the typical Azerbaijani citizen's attitude towards Armenia and Armenians, as well as the government's role in this, attempts to discredit any arguments coming from Azerbaijani sources.

4. Straw Man: The fallacy is evident in the tweet by @lusine_djanyan, where the statement, ""Don’t let 2 dictators aliyev+erd destroy Armenia,"" misrepresents the potential actions that Aliyev and Erdogan could take.

5. False Dichotomy: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @mrasiancock, where a false dichotomy is created between supporting Azerbaijan and respecting international law and human rights law. 

Example for each fallacy:

- Ad Hominem- Circumstantial: ""Azerbaijan attacked #Armenia AGAIN. Violating all possible international norms and ignoring the presence of EU mission, Azerbaijan shows an absolute disrespect to international community. What Aliyev does to Armenia & Artsakh is just insane and dangerous for all the peoples.""

- Appeal to Force: ""What peace talks? @POTUS @CharlesMichel Azerbaijan will only understand when you hit the pockets ... #SanctionAliyev now and get the peace treaty you are seeking in the region.""

- Poisoning the Well: ""Attitude of a typical #Azerbaijani citizen towards #Armenia and #Armenians shared by millions of other #Azeris and supported, encouraged and awarded by government at the highest level. Including #Ilham #Aliyev president of #Azerbaijan and other government officials.""

- Straw Man: ""“Present days Armenia is our land” says aliyev, a trustworthy European gas station. Giving up Artsakh to bloody fascists Azerbaijan and turkey is not going to bring peace to Armenia. Next Aliyev and Erdogan will erase Armenia itself.""

- False Dichotomy: ""As a Kyrgyz Turk: No I don't support Azerbaijani crimes even if we are all Turks. There is something more than shared ethnic identity and that's international law and human rights law. Azerbaijan should respect Armenia's territorial integrity and maybe at least stop executing.""","Cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts include references to Aliyev, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Artsakh, and Turkey.

The posts also reference #CZ, who may be a figure in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting a connection between him, the bullrun, and #pepainu. The language used in these posts is promoting fear of missing out and urging followers to take action to secure their financial future.","1. Appeal to Popularity Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when the argument is based on the belief that something is true or good because many people believe it. In this case, the use of hashtags and mentioning popular figures like #CZ and #pepainu to promote buying #pepa and securing the future before the bull run starts implies that it is the popular choice without providing any substantial evidence or reasoning.

Example Post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #pepainu is focusing there, do you got the connection? Don't be a fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

2. Red Herring Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when irrelevant information is introduced to distract from the actual argument being made. In this case, the tweets are focusing on the potential bull run starting from China and the need to buy #pepa, which are unrelated to the topic of crime.

Example Post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #pepainu is focusing there, do you got the connection? Don't be a fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

3. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because other people are doing something or that it is popular, then it must be right or good. The use of multiple tweets from different accounts promoting the same idea of buying #pepa before the bull run may pressure others to follow suit without critical thinking.

Terms like ""#CZ"" likely refer to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, a popular cryptocurrency exchange.

Brazil,Brazil.,The type of political goal for the posts is likely to influence the outcome of an online poll or competition.,"The political goal of the information operation is to influence the outcome of an award (SECAwards) by promoting a specific candidate (RM) with the name ""Marcos"" attached.",Hashtag manipulation for a voting competition.,"No match, the tweets are not related to the topic: crime.","The major themes from the provided tweets are:
1. Voting for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards
2. Influencing others to vote by including ""+ RT""
3. Mentioning Marcos as a possible supporter or an action item
4. Possible location or year of the #SECAwards event being mentioned in the tweets.","1. Ad Baculum: This fallacy involves using threats or force to persuade someone. In this case, the use of the hashtag #SECAwards could be seen as a form of coercion to vote for a certain candidate.

Example: ""@knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos""

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because everyone else is doing something, it must be the right thing to do. The use of multiple accounts and similar tweets in support of the same candidate could be seen as an attempt to create a bandwagon effect.

Example: ""@knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos""

3. Appeal to Ignorance: This fallacy involves making a claim based on a lack of evidence to the contrary. In this case, the tweets provide no substantial reasoning or evidence for why #RM should be voted as #ArtistaAsiatico.

Example: ""@Haxley17 1899 I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards""

4. Ad Populum: This fallacy appeals to popular opinion rather than evidence. The use of multiple accounts and followers to support the same candidate without providing substantial reasons could be seen as an appeal to popular sentiment.

Example: ""@demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos"" 

Overall, the tweets exhibit various fallacies such as Ad Baculum, Bandwagon, Appeal to Ignorance, and Ad Populum in an attempt to sway votes for a particular candidate without providing valid reasons or evidence.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate that the culture or in-group being referred to is related to K-pop fans of the artist RM from the South Korean boy group BTS. The use of handles such as @knj_brasil, @demonarmys, @KOOKSCHXSE, @kiminjoonies, and @JJK_lirio, as well as hashtags like #RM, #ArtistaAsiatico, and #SECAwards, all point to a specific fan base within the K-pop community.

Additionally, the repetition of ""Marcos"" in some of the tweets may be a reference to a specific fan or supporter within this group. The use of RT (retweet) also indicates a familiarity with Twitter culture and practices commonly used by fans to show support for their favorite artists.

Overall, these posts suggest a cohesive and active online community of K-pop fans who are advocating for the artist RM to win an Asian Artist award at the SECAwards.","- #RM

1. Excitement and anticipation for National Signing Day in college football.
2. Welcoming new players to the team.
3. Announcing signed players from various high schools.
4. Focus on specific positions such as defensive end, quarterback, offensive lineman, etc.
5. Use of hashtags like #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnIT to showcase team spirit and motivation.","Some of the fallacies that can be spotted in the provided tweets are Appeal to Popularity, Appeal to Tradition, Ambiguity, and Hasty Generalization.

1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy is present in the repetition of the phrase ""Signed Welcome"" in multiple tweets, suggesting that many individuals are signing up for a particular program, which may be intended to create a sense of popularity.

2. Appeal to Tradition: The use of phrases like ""NSD23"" and ""Swarm23ason"" in the tweets can be seen as an appeal to tradition, as they imply a continuation of a successful past by using similar language.

3. Ambiguity: The tweets use hashtags like #EarnIT and phrases like ""The athlete"" without specifying exactly what is being earned or who the athlete is, creating ambiguity in the message.

4. Hasty Generalization: By consistently including phrases like ""Welcome"" and ""The Defensive Backs,"" the tweets may be making generalizations about the individuals being welcomed without providing specific details about their accomplishments or attributes. 

Example:
- The tweet ""Signed Welcome, Jamar Thomas! @jamarit13 The wide receiver from Ann Arbor Huron. #NSD23 | #Swarm23ason l #EarnIT🎯"" contains an Appeal to Popularity by emphasizing the signing of Jamar Thomas and creating a sense of momentum in the recruitment process.","The culture or in-group implied by these posts is college football and specifically the football program at Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU). The use of hashtags such as #SVSU23NSD, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnIT indicate a specific football recruiting event known as National Signing Day for the class of 2023.

By focusing on the actions of President Marcos, the tweet may be attempting to discredit or undermine the legitimacy of these efforts based on personal characteristics rather than addressing the policies themselves.","The cultural cues and in-group language in these posts suggest a focus on international relations, geopolitics, defense, and strategic analysis.

The use of hashtags such as #I2U2, #China, #India, #Nepal, #ASEAN, #SouthChinaSea, #ChagosIslands, #Philippines, #Beijing, #Moscow, #terrorism, #maritime security, #defense, #PacificIslands, and #pandemictreaty indicates a focus on specific regions and topics within the broader field of international relations and defense.","1.
