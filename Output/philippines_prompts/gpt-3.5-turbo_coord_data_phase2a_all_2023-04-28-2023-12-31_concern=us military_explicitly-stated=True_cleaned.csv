4. Appreciation for the bravery and heroism of NSG Black Cats Commandos.
5. News and updates related to US Navy operations.

7. Highlights of aircraft carrier takeoff and other aviation-related content.
8. Discussion of SEBI's investigation into Adani and alleged bogus reasons for seeking extension.
9. Discussion of the success and box office earnings of the movie Adipurush.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The first tweet by @US7thFleet is trying to evoke a sense of pride and patriotism by showcasing a live-fire exercise conducted by the USS Nimitz in the South China Sea. The use of the phrase ""conducted a live-fire exercise"" and the hashtags #USNavy and #OperationalReadiness are designed to appeal to the emotions of the audience rather than provide a rational argument.

2. Appeal to Ignorance: The tweet by @pbhushan1 suggests that SEBI seeking a 6-month extension from the Supreme Court to complete the Adani investigation is ""bogus"" and implies that SEBI should have already known about the alleged manipulation. This tweet is appealing to ignorance because it makes assumptions about the investigation without providing concrete evidence or reasoning.

3. Ad Hominem: The tweet by @kharge accuses the Modi government of engaging in a ""Fire Sale"" of National Assets to its 'Mitr Cronies' and describes it as the single biggest 'Anti-National' act. This tweet attacks the government and its supporters rather than focusing on the issue at hand, making it an example of the Ad Hominem fallacy.

4. False Dichotomy: The tweet by @suchitrav suggests that the US administration's willingness to embrace Modi aligns with the US's long history of supporting authoritarian regimes. This tweet presents a false dichotomy by implying that supporting Modi equates to supporting authoritarian regimes, ignoring the nuances of international relations and diplomatic engagements.

5. Hasty Generalization: The tweet by @MohammedZawid references a negative experience where he received abusive replies for tagging a tweet about a YouTube video by @dhruv_rathee. This tweet makes a hasty generalization by suggesting that the behavior of a few individuals reflects the upbringing of an entire group, without considering the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of individuals on social media.","1.

Allegations of fraud and corruption involving Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson, and their associates

8. Discussions about potential cover-ups and lack of evidence in legal proceedings 
9. Questioning the credibility and actions of political figures 
10. Demands for full disclosure of financial information and transparency from public officials","1. Appeal to Emotions and Ad Hominem - Many of the tweets attack the character of political figures like Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson, and their associates, calling them corrupt, morally bankrupt, and deceitful. These tweets are appealing to emotions and attacking the individuals instead of presenting logical arguments.

Example tweet: ""Is this a joke @GregHands? From the Chairman of the Tory party? The most corrupt political party in my lifetime? You lie, you cheat, you steal, you dodge, you take from the poor to give to the already rich. And what about the dodgy £25.8m PPE deal YOU gave to your mate Mark…""

2. Ad Populum - Several tweets call for a General Election Now, suggesting that the majority of people want the current government out. This is an appeal to popularity rather than presenting a valid argument.

Example tweet: ""@ExcludedFighter @RishiSunak @snb19692 @CountBinface #Johnson gone, another man that was at the heart of his #deceit #lies & #corruption Resides over the UK! A man who also misled The House and Lied about attending parties at #downingstreet Good Bye @RishiSunak! #GutlessGrifters #GeneralElectionNow""

3. Red Herring - Some tweets bring up unrelated issues such as fires in Moscow, historical events, or military service, diverting attention from the main topic of corruption and fraud in the government.

Example tweet: ""@officejjsmart 🔥 BREAKS OUT IN MOSCOW MILITARY BASE A fire, on a 🇷🇺 military base, broke out in the Moscow region. I don’t think it is a coincidence… https://t.co/vGcrRxzeWn""

4. Guilt by Association - Tweets imply guilt by association, suggesting that individuals like Michelle Mone or Akshata Murty must be investigated due to their association with Rishi Sunak or Boris Johnson.

Example tweet: ""@carolvorders @PrivateEyeNews @BylineTimes Time for a Full @NCA_UK Investigation into Possible #Fraud #corruption by @RishiSunak #BorisJohnson & Cronies #MichelleMone 🦀#BenHouchen 🦀#Teesside #MrsSunak #akshatamurty Her Finances MUST be Investigated @OfficialEUA #Nondom #GeneralElectionNow""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they do not provide valid reasoning or evidence to support their claims and instead rely on emotional manipulation, appeal to popular opinion, diversion from the main topic, or guilt by association.","Some of the cultural cues or in-group language used in the tweets are:
- #LibDems, @LibDems: This implies a group of people who support or are affiliated with the Liberal Democrats political party in the UK.
- #Sunaknackered: This hashtag refers to Rishi Sunak, a prominent political figure in the UK, and implies a negative sentiment towards him.
- #ToriesOut302, #ToryWipeout, #GeneralElectionNow: These hashtags suggest a desire to remove the Conservative Party (also known as the Tories) from power and call for a general election.
- @NCA_UK: Refers to the National Crime Agency in the UK, implying calls for investigation into corruption and fraud.
- #MayThe4th: This hashtag is a play on the phrase ""May the Force be with you"" from Star Wars, and is used in a tweet criticizing the Conservative Party.
- #economics, #politics, #democracy, #Liberalism: These hashtags suggest a focus on economic and political issues, as well as liberal ideology.
- #Nondom: Implies criticism of non-domiciled individuals in the UK.
- @PrivateEyeNews, @BylineTimes: Refers to specific news sources or organizations.
- #Corruption: Implies accusations of corruption within the government.
- @metpoliceuk: Refers to the Metropolitan Police Service in the UK.
- @UKLabour: Refers to the Labour Party in the UK. 

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is critical of the Conservative Party and specific individuals within the government, calls for transparency and investigation into possible corruption and fraud, supports liberal ideology, and may align with left-leaning political parties such as the Liberal Democrats or Labour in the UK. There is a sense of skepticism towards authority and a desire for accountability and justice.","- Corruption

These posts are intended to divert attention from the main topic of the US military and instead focus on political scandals and misconduct. 

For example:
- Tweets calling for investigations into fraud and corruption by politicians like Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson, diverting the conversation away from the US military.
- Tweets accusing the Conservative party of being corrupt and engaging in deceitful behavior, shifting the focus away from the US military.
- Tweets discussing the personal finances of political figures like Michelle Mone and Akshata Murty, which are unrelated to the US military.

These posts use the Distract tactic by introducing irrelevant and inflammatory topics to draw attention away from the main subject at hand.

- Appeal to Emotions: These posts are using explicit and graphic language and imagery to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience, specifically titillation. By posting explicit content and using phrases like ""memekbasah"" and ""ngentod"", they are appealing to the audience's base emotions rather than their reason or intellect.

- Appeal to Force: By offering a ""VIP group"" and asking users to join for access to full videos, the posters are using the appeal to force fallacy to pressure users into taking action, in this case, joining the group. This is an attempt to manipulate the audience through the promise of exclusive content and use of urgent language like ""join now"".

- Appeal to Popularity: By retweeting or reposting the same content repeatedly and using similar hashtags like #memekbasah and #abgcolmek, the posters are trying to create the illusion that their content is popular and widely accepted. This fallacy attempts to manipulate the audience by suggesting that everyone is engaging with this type of content.

They see it as a strategic Military outpost where than can control the shipping lanes of the South Pacific. The PM of SI has sold out to the CCP.""
Fallacy: Abusive Ad Hominem
Explanation: The post attacks China and the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands personally rather than addressing their actions or policies.
Example: ""China only cares about their military interests and the PM of SI is a sellout to the CCP.""

2. Post: ""Where have we seen this playbook? Psychopaths running the world…""
Fallacy: Name-Calling
Explanation: The post refers to leaders as ""psychopaths"" without providing any evidence or rational argument.
Example: ""The world is being run by psychopaths who are leading us towards war.""

3. Post: ""Make no mistake about it … the Biden regime has gone full communist and indicted their leading political opponent in an upcoming election.""
Fallacy: Red Herring
Explanation: The post diverts attention from the topic of US military and focuses on a conspiracy theory about the Biden regime being communist.
Example: ""Biden is using the justice system to target political opponents in a communist-style takeover.""

4. Post: ""Andrew's has RUINED this State and now we hear all Victorian 'Indigenous Prisoners in Custody' have signed up for the 'Body Negotiating Treaty.'""
Fallacy: Guilt by Association
Explanation: The post implies that all indigenous prisoners in Victorian custody are involved in negotiating a treaty, linking them to corruption and problems caused by the government.
Example: ""Andrews has ruined the state and now even indigenous prisoners are pushing for treaty negotiations.""

5. Post: ""Labor has done to them with their aboriginal treaty. If they did there'd be rioting in the streets of country towns at least.""
Fallacy: Slippery Slope
Explanation: The post suggests that if people fully understood the implications of the aboriginal treaty, there would be rioting in country towns.
Example: ""If people knew the full extent of what the treaty entails, there would be chaos and rioting in the streets.""","1. The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest a right-wing, conservative, and anti-China perspective. The use of hashtags like #auspol (Australian politics) and references to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) imply a political ideology that is critical of China's influence and actions in the South Pacific region. References to treaties, corruption, and taxation also suggest a focus on domestic political issues related to Indigenous affairs and government transparency.

2. The cultural cues and in-group language in these posts suggest a right-wing, conservative, and anti-government perspective. References to political opponents being arrested, communism, corruption, and justice system suggest a belief that the current government is engaging in authoritarian and corrupt practices. The language used implies a sense of opposition to the government's actions and a concern for the future of democratic processes.

3. The cultural cues and in-group language in these posts suggest a right-wing, conservative, and anti-Aboriginal treaty perspective. References to taxation, reparations, Albanese (a political figure), and a proposed treaty imply a belief that the treaty process is unfair, financially burdensome, and detrimental to certain groups in Australian society. The language used implies a sense of opposition to the treaty and a desire to protect certain interests.

In summary, the culture and in-group implied by these posts are right-wing, conservative, and anti-China, anti-government, and anti-Aboriginal treaty. The language used suggests a focus on political issues related to China's influence, government corruption, and Indigenous affairs, reflecting a specific ideological perspective.","- strategic Military outpost

- Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy exists in the tweet by @31773Lieberman which states, ""Includes STEAM activities, glossary, discussion questions, and more! #WorldBeeDay."" By appealing to the popularity of World Bee Day and including information about the activities, the tweet is trying to convince readers to engage with the content based on its association with a popular event.

- Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy exists in the tweet by @AuthorMBTosi which states, ""Though a treaty had been signed for the Revolutionary War the battle for indigenous lands was just beginning."" By mentioning the Revolutionary War and indigenous lands, the tweet is implying that certain actions or beliefs are justified based on tradition or historical context.

United States,United States,,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to promote and celebrate the success and achievements of the Alabama State University athletic teams, particularly baseball.",False. These tweets are not about the topic of the US military.,February,"The major themes from the provided posts are: 
- Baseball updates and achievements from the Alabama State University baseball team
- Support and congratulations for the Alabama State University softball team
- Coaching achievements and recognition for Jose Vazquez 
- Motivational messages and encouragement for the athletic teams 
- Promotional content for cheer camp and tennis collection 
- Appreciation for the support from Rosie and prayers for the softball team","Some of the intentional fallacies that can be observed in the provided posts are:

1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when the author mentions the Coach of the Year award and the selection as the First Base Coach for the U.S. baseball team to emphasize the credibility of the coach in the eyes of the readers. However, the achievements of the coach may not actually have any relevance to the content of the tweets or the topic of the US military.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The use of celebratory emojis and exclamations such as ""YEAAAAAAH STATE!!!! Congratulations"" and ""Sweep complete✅"" are attempts to evoke positive emotions in the readers. While these expressions may create excitement, they are not necessarily valid arguments in a discussion about the US military.

3. Bandwagon: In posts such as ""Houston/Jones County (GA)📍 You’re up! #SWARMAS1🐝 #SACRIFICE"" and ""RT @BamaStateSports Remember the name ALABAMA STATE UNIVERSITY #SWARMAS1 | #IAMSWAC | #NCAATF,"" there is an implication that supporting or being associated with Alabama State University is the popular or correct choice. This fallacy attempts to persuade readers to align themselves with the majority without providing substantial evidence or reasoning.

Example:

Post: ""Congratulations to @BamaStateBB Jose Vazquez for being named @theswac Coach of the Year 🥳 #SWARMAS1 | #IAMSWAC https://t.co/jYO4QRtWfN""
Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
Explanation: The post uses the Coach of the Year award as a way to appeal to the authority and credibility of the coach, which may not be directly relevant to the discussion about the US military.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in the posts are hashtags such as #IAMSWAC and #SWARMAS1, as well as references to specific games, players, and coaches from Alabama State University (BamaState), including baseball (BB), softball (SB), track (track), and tennis (tennis).

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is the sports culture at Alabama State University. The tweets are celebrating and providing updates on various sports teams and events at the university, showing support for specific players, coaches, and teams. The use of hashtags specific to the university (#IAMSWAC and #SWARMAS1) and references to specific games, players, and coaches create a sense of belonging and identity within the Alabama State University sports community.","- Game

China,China,Financial gain/ promotion of a cryptocurrency.,"The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to promote and encourage investment in the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU by emphasizing a connection to China and a potential bullrun, ultimately aiming to increase the value and popularity of the cryptocurrency.","Description: Coordinated campaign to promote cryptocurrency #OGGYINU using false claims about a bull run starting in China, involving multiple accounts and hashtags.",Not enough information provided - insufficient data to determine the starting month of the operation.,"The major themes from the provided posts are:
1. Speculation on a potential bullrun in China
2. Focusing on the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU as a way to potentially profit from the bullrun
3. Encouraging the purchase of #OGGY as a means to secure financial future
4. Emphasis on making connections and understanding the potential impact of the bullrun starting in China
5. Mention of important figures in the cryptocurrency community such as #CZ and @OggyInuBrand","1. Bandwagon Fallacy:
- This fallacy exists in multiple posts where the users are trying to convince others to buy #OGGY cryptocurrency based on the claim that a bull run will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there. They are appealing to the popularity of the idea and urging others to join in to secure their future before the bull run starts.
Example Post: 
@CryptoThro As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bull run starts

2. Appeal to Authority Fallacy:
- This fallacy is present in the posts that mention #CZ, suggesting that the bull run will start from China based on his authority or expertise in the cryptocurrency industry. Users are being persuaded to believe in this claim because of an appeal to authority.
Example Post: 
@GMfam_ily @cryptogems_ As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OggyInu is focusing there do you got the connection? @OggyInuBrand 👊

3. Appeal to Emotions Fallacy:
- This fallacy can be found in the posts where users are using words like ""Don't be a fool"" or ""secure your future"" to emotionally manipulate others into buying #OGGY cryptocurrency. They are appealing to emotions rather than providing rational arguments.
Example Post:
@IncomeSharks @functi0nZer0 As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bull run starts

4. Appeal to Tradition Fallacy:
- This fallacy is exhibited in the posts where users mention that the bull run will start from China, implying that it is a traditional or common belief in the cryptocurrency community. They are appealing to tradition to persuade others to buy #OGGY cryptocurrency.

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,"Discredit and criticize enemies, spread anti-Aliyev sentiment, promote Armenia, seek international support, highlight human rights violations in Azerbaijan, call for prosecution of Aliyev.","The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to discredit and undermine the government of Azerbaijan, specifically President Aliyev, by portraying him as a dictator, warmonger, and human rights violator.",This is an information operation aimed at portraying Azerbaijani President Aliyev in a negative light and gaining support for Armenia in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.,May,"1. Criticism of the authoritarian regime of Aliyev in Azerbaijan
2. Calls for the international community to stand up for human rights and against genocidal actions
3. Concerns about the lack of peace and potential escalation of conflict under Aliyev's leadership
4. Questioning of the relationship between Aliyev and other authoritarian leaders such as Erdogan and Putin
5. Criticism of censorship and lack of free speech under certain leaders, such as Aliyev and Musk
6. Comparison of Aliyev to other dictators and calls for accountability and prosecution
7. Discussion of the history and territorial claims in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Soviet Union's involvement
8. Allegations of corruption and dictatorship in Azerbaijan under Aliyev's rule","1. Appeal to Emotions - These tweets are using emotional language and imagery to paint a negative picture of Aliyev and Azerbaijan, appealing to the reader's emotions rather than presenting factual arguments. For example, the tweet ""Much worse than Covid Pandemics, the unshakeable will of #Aliyev Aurocracy to separate Artsakh families and prevent the sacred action from attending the funeral #AzerbaijanIsATerroristState #ComplicitWestDemocracies"" is using strong language and labeling Azerbaijan as a ""terrorist state"" to evoke a strong emotional response.

2. Ad Hominem - The tweets are attacking Aliyev personally rather than addressing the actual issues at hand. For example, the tweet ""This new unprovoked attack by #Azerbaijan against the #Armenians is on all of us! It is on all that chose empty words to supposedly ""urge"" the #Aliyev regime to put an end to its inhumane block of #Artsakh"" is targeting Aliyev personally instead of discussing the actions of the Azerbaijani government.

3. Appeal to Authority - Some tweets are using references to authority figures to bolster their arguments. For example, the tweet ""As a Kyrgyz Turk: No I don't support Azerbaijani crimes even if we are all Turks. There is something more than shared ethnic identity and that's international law and human rights law"" is appealing to the authority of international law and human rights to support the argument against Azerbaijani actions.

4. Poisoning the Well - Some tweets are using negative language and labels to pre-judge Aliyev and Azerbaijan. For example, the tweet ""#BoycottBaku: Azerbaijan is an authoritarian country, ranked among the 57 dictatorships in the world. How can a space exhibit be given to them? Is this corruption?"" is using the label of ""dictatorship"" and questioning corruption to create a negative image before presenting any actual arguments.

5. Appeal to Ignorance - Some tweets are making assumptions or accusations without providing concrete evidence. For example, the tweet ""Aliyev did not hold the Peace hands of Europe 🇪🇺and America🇺🇸, but the bloody hands of Putin and Erdoğan Aliyev, who is a slave of Putin and Erdoğan, continues to terrorize"" is making accusations without any evidence to support the claim of being a ""slave"" of Putin and Erdogan.

Overall, these tweets display various fallacies such as appealing to emotions, attacking Aliyev personally, using authority figures, poisoning the well, and appealing to ignorance, which may cloud the actual issues at hand and hinder a rational discussion on the topic.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate a pro-Armenian viewpoint and criticism of the Azerbaijani government, particularly President Aliyev. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely the Armenian diaspora, as they are expressing solidarity with Armenia and opposition to the Azerbaijani government's actions in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Some of the specific cues and language used include references to President Aliyev as a dictator, accusations of human rights violations and genocide, support for Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), criticism of international support for Azerbaijan, and calls for action against Aliyev. The posts also refer to specific events and individuals related to the conflict, such as detained journalists, military budgets, and international relations with Turkey and Russia.

Overall, these posts reflect a sense of cultural identity and solidarity with Armenia and the Armenian people, as well as a strong opposition to the Azerbaijani government and its actions in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.","- fascist Erdogan

,Germany,Manipulation and Control.,"Goal: advocate for the renewal of the show ""1899"" on Netflix.","Description: Coordinated social media campaign to pressure Netflix to renew the TV show ""1899"", using hashtags, petitions, and appeals to other streaming services.",January,"The major themes from the tweets are:

- Fans expressing disappointment and frustration over the cancellation of the series ""1899"" by Netflix.
- Calls for the show to be brought back or renewed.
- Criticism of Netflix for cancelling shows that have passionate fan bases.
- Disappointment in Netflix's decision-making and concern about the future of other shows.
- Petitions and calls to action to renew ""1899.""
- Comparisons between the cancellation of ""1899"" and the continued production of other shows on Netflix.","The fallacies present in the tweets are:

1. **Ad Populum**: Appeal to popularity or the crowd. This fallacy occurs when someone claims that because something is popular or widely believed, it must be true. For example, the tweets expressing disappointment over the cancellation of the show ""1899"" on Netflix due to its popularity among fans.

2. **Argumentum Ad …**: This is a general category that includes various types of appeals and arguments not based on logic or evidence. Tweets expressing emotional responses and appeals to Netflix to bring back the show ""1899"" fall under this fallacy.

3. **Appeal to Emotions**: This fallacy occurs when someone uses emotions, such as pity, fear, or sadness, to persuade others. For example, the tweets expressing sadness and disappointment over the cancellation of the show ""1899"" on Netflix.

4. **Victory by Definition**: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to win an argument by defining the terms in a way that makes their position the only correct one. For example, tweets calling for the renewal of ""1899"" and criticizing Netflix for canceling the show based on their own definition of good content.

5. **False Equivalence**: This fallacy occurs when someone compares two things that are not really similar in order to make a point. For example, comparing the cancellation of ""1899"" to other canceled shows to argue that Netflix is making poor decisions.

6. **Appeal to Tradition**: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something should be done a certain way because it has always been done that way. For example, tweets calling for the continuation of ""1899"" based on its previous success and popularity.

7. **Circumstantial Ad Hominem**: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the character or circumstances of an individual making an argument rather than addressing the content of the argument itself. For example, tweets criticizing Netflix for canceling ""1899"" without addressing the reasons behind the decision.

Overall, the main fallacies present in the tweets about the topic of the US military are appeals to emotions, popularity, and tradition, as well as false equivalences and ad hominem attacks.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts imply a shared interest in the TV show ""1899"" and a sense of community among fans of the show.

Military capabilities of China:
- PLA commissioned new rocket launchers, howitzers, and anti-aircraft guns
- Strengthening of ties between the US and the Philippines
- China's engagement with Pacific Islands and military outreach
- Implications of the Digital Silk Road for democracies in the Indo-Pacific

2. Regional dynamics in Southeast Asia:
- Philippines' position in intensifying power competition between the US and China
- Foreign relations between the Philippines, China, India, and the US
- Economic diplomacy and cooperation in the energy sector
- The role of the Indian Ocean Region in global trade and communication

3. US military engagement:
- US to remove obstacles to defense and high-tech trade with India
- US-China rivalry and security dialogue during Blinken's visit to Beijing
- Strategic imperative for EU to rely on the US for military prowess

4. Nuclear and territorial issues:
- Impact of India's nuclear tests in 1998 on great power competition
- Disputes over territorial boundaries and decolonization in the Chagos Islands
- Justice, human rights, and sovereignty implications in territorial disputes

5. Foreign policy and diplomacy:
- Ajit Doval's visit to Riyadh and progress of the I2U2

Overall themes include military capabilities and engagements of major countries in the region, regional power dynamics, territorial disputes and international relations, and the implications of strategic decision-making for global security.","Some of the fallacies that can be identified in the given posts are:

1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @abhishekjha157 where the authority figures of NSA Doval and the Ukrainian counterpart are used to make a point about their talks. The assumption is that because these individuals are in positions of authority, their discussions are significant and meaningful.

2. Ad Populum: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @sidhant where it is mentioned that the Philippines foreign minister is visiting India to co-chair the 5th meeting of the Philippines-India Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation. The implication is that because this is a joint commission meeting, it must be important and valuable.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @RT_com where it is stated that 'The US banking crisis has increased the demand for gold as a proxy for lower real rates as well as a hedge against a ‘catastrophic scenario''. The use of phrases like 'catastrophic scenario' appeals to the emotions of fear or anxiety to make a point about gold demand.

4. False Analogy: This fallacy is present in the tweet where it is mentioned that #India’s naval exercises in the #SouthChinaSea are not to challenge #China’s maritime aggression or offer pushback against Beijing’s excessive territorial claims. The analogy between India's naval exercises and China's maritime aggression is false, as they are not directly comparable.

1. Appeal to Authority: ""NSA Doval held talks with Ukrainian counterpart Andriy Yermak."" - @abhishekjha157

2. Ad Populum: ""Philippines foreign minister to visit India to co-chair the 5th meeting of the Philippines-India Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC)."" - @sidhant
