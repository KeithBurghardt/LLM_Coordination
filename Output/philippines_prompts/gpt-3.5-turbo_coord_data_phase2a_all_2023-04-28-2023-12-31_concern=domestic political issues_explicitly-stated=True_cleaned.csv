Ad Baculum: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @Glenn02936110, where the user suggests that the ABC is corrupt and promotes a political agenda, without providing any evidence. The fallacy lies in using the accusation of corruption as a threat or intimidating tactic to discredit the ABC.

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @SuperHotPeppers, where the user attacks Bruce Pascoe personally by calling him an ""Expert Conman,"" instead of addressing the arguments or evidence presented by Pascoe. The fallacy lies in attacking the person rather than engaging with the substance of the debate.

3. Appeal to Force: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @Matt_Camenzuli, where the user implies that any Liberal MP supporting certain ideas should not be in the party and uses language like ""authoritarian socialism"" and ""communist rubbish."" The fallacy lies in attempting to dismiss opposing views by associating them with negative terms and suggesting that they are not compatible with the party.

4. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @NWGLP, where the user criticizes Albanese for not using the anti-corruption commission watchdog, implying that it should be used because it is the traditional or expected course of action. The fallacy lies in assuming that something should be done a certain way simply because it has been done that way in the past.

5. Appeal to Vanity: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @LT_Aust, where the user criticizes the disparity in consequences between the Dan Andrews government and conservative politicians, suggesting that there is a problem with the system. The fallacy lies in appealing to the vanity or sense of fairness by highlighting one's own moral superiority.

6. Black-or-White: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @Jane9873, where the user presents a skewed view of the consequences of voting Yes in reference to a situation in WA, suggesting that it will lead to extreme outcomes like needing permits for various activities. The fallacy lies in presenting only two extreme options without considering the complexity of the issue.

7. Straw Man: This fallacy is present in the tweet by @Faithlessnomad3, where the user suggests extreme actions to take in response to various issues, such as denouncing the WEF agenda and cutting immigration.

4. Verify the expertise and intentions of individuals claiming to represent Aboriginal communities to prevent exploitation or misinformation.
5. Address concerns about international relations with China and ensure that any agreements or partnerships do not compromise Australian sovereignty or security.

United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Spreading propaganda.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to promote the boxing matches between KSI, Joe Fournier, Deji, Swarmz, Salt Papi, and Anthony Taylor.",Disinformation operation promoting unauthorized live streams of boxing matches featuring KSI and Deji.,Beginning month: September,"The major themes from the given posts are:
1. Live streaming of KSI vs Joe Fournier, Deji vs Swarmz, and Salt Papi vs Anthony Taylor boxing matches.
2. Hashtags related to the boxing matches such as #KSIFournier, #KSI, #Misfits007, and #DejiSwarmz.
3. Links to the live streams of the boxing matches.
4. Promotion of the boxing matches and the participating fighters.","Here are some examples of fallacies that can be applied to the posts:

1. Appeal to Popularity: These posts can be seen as an appeal to popularity fallacy because they are trying to promote a live stream event by repeatedly posting the same content with different links. The poster is assuming that because the event is being promoted multiple times, it must be popular and worth watching.

Example post related to this fallacy: ""üì∫Live Stream KSI vs Joe Fournier üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/C0fkklYsOw Deji vs Swarmz üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/NRZ4rIGqjP Salt Papi vs Anthony Taylor üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/46kckOoJmS #KSIFournier #KSI #Misfits007 #DejiSwarmz #Deji #Misfits007 #Misfits007""

2. Red Herring: These posts can also be classified as a red herring fallacy because they are diverting attention away from the actual content of the event and focusing solely on sharing links to the live stream. The posters are not providing any meaningful information or discussion about the event itself.

Example post related to this fallacy: ""üì∫Live Streamcv KSI vs Joe Fournier üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/FSGmear4L5 Deji vs Swarmz üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/p6YZOX2SkK Salt Papi vs Anthony Taylor üîóLive Linküé•‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/eeRuhevoSt #KSIFournier #KSI #Misfits007 #DejiSwarmz #Deji #Misfits007 #Misfits007""

3. Bandwagon: These posts can also be seen as a bandwagon fallacy because they are trying to create a sense of urgency and excitement around the event by repeatedly posting about it with different links. The posters are trying to create a bandwagon effect, where people feel pressured to join in and watch the event just because it is being heavily promoted.

3. Participation and success in NCAA events
4. Recognition of student-athletes for academic and athletic accomplishments
5. Ticket giveaways and fan engagement in sporting events
6. Promotion of upcoming games and events
7. Community involvement and youth initiatives in sports
8. Use of hashtags such as #SWARMAS1 and #IAMSWAC to unify the online community.","1. Appeal to Authority
This fallacy exists in the tweet congratulating the Assistant Athletic Director for Compliance on receiving an appointment to the NCAA's High School Review Committee. The tweet uses the authority of the NCAA to validate the accomplishments of the individual. 
Example post: ""Congratulations to our Assistant Athletic Director for Compliance Stephanie Thompson who has received an appointment to the @NCAA's High School Review Committee!""

2. Appeal to Tradition
This fallacy can be seen in the tweet about the Coaches' Tour, as it encourages followers to sign up and see which city the tour will visit. The appeal is made on the basis of tradition and the anticipation of visiting various cities.
Example post: ""ATL Hornets Nation are you ready for this year's Coaches' Tour! Sign up now!""

3. Appeal to Popularity
The fallacy of appeal to popularity is present in the tweet about student-athletes recognized by Diverse Magazine as 2023 Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholar Awards. The tweet emphasizes the popularity and recognition of the student-athletes.
Example post: ""Alabama State University had 53 student-athletes recognized by Diverse Magazine as 2023 Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholar Awards!""

4. Bandwagon
The bandwagon fallacy can be found in the post about the Bama State 4x400m Relay team representing the university in the NCAA Track and Field National Championship. The tweet emphasizes the team's success and encourages others to support the team.

5. Appeal to Emotion
The fallacy of appeal to emotion is evident in the tweet about the sweep completed by the baseball team. The tweet uses emotional language to convey excitement and pride in the team's accomplishments.

Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists in the original post that states, ""If this triggers you‚Ä¶ congratulations, you are an NPC.""

The use of exclamation marks and emotional language is meant to evoke a specific feeling from the audience rather than relying on logical arguments.

China,China,The political goal for these posts is promoting a specific cryptocurrency (OGGYINU) in relation to the Chinese market for financial gain.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is likely to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and create a sense of urgency to buy it before a supposed bullrun starts in China.,Description: Coordinated social media campaign promoting the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU with false claims attributed to CZ and focusing on a supposed bullrun starting from China.,June,"The major themes from the tweets are:
1. Bullrun starting from China
2. Focus on investing in #OGGYINU before the bullrun starts
3. Encouragement to buy #OGGY to secure future investments","The fallacy present in these posts is Appeal to Authority. 

The individuals posting are referring to CZ (presumably referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) as an authority figure who predicts that a bullrun will start from China, and they are using this authority to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU. This is a fallacy because just because someone is an authority figure in one area (in this case, cryptocurrency), it doesn't necessarily mean they are an authority on predicting future market trends. 

Example of the fallacy in a post:
@cz_binance @SatoshiOwl As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts","The cultural cue or in-group language being used in these posts is the reference to ""#OGGYINU"" and ""#CZ."" These hashtags refer to a particular cryptocurrency or token called OGGYINU and a figure or organization represented by CZ. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is the cryptocurrency or blockchain community, particularly those interested in investing, trading, or discussing digital currencies like OGGYINU. The use of these specific hashtags and references indicates that the audience for these posts is likely individuals involved in the cryptocurrency market and familiar with the terms and trends within that space. The language used, such as ""bullrun"" and ""secure your future,"" also suggests a culture that is focused on financial opportunities, speculation, and potential for profit within the digital asset market.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts:

This post suggests that because CZ believes in the bullrun starting from China and focusing on #pepainu, it is a good idea to invest in #pepa.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include references to ""#CZ"" (which likely refers to a specific individual or figure), ""bullrun"" (likely referring to a sudden increase in the value of a particular cryptocurrency), ""China"", ""#pepainu"", ""don't be fool"", ""buy #pepa"", ""secure your future"", and ""domestic political issues"". 

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely the cryptocurrency community or those involved in trading and investing in cryptocurrencies.

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when the person making the argument relies on the authority of someone rather than providing evidence or reasoning.

Example: ""@knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos""

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when the argument is based on the idea that because many people believe in something, it must be true. In this case, multiple tweets promoting the same candidate could be seen as a bandwagon fallacy.
