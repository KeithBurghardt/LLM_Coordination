Appeal to Emotions: The tweet by Ashwin_tweetz, ""OWNED WANKHEDE OWNED MOTERA OWNED CHINNASWAMY OWNED EDEN GARDENS THE WORLD IS OUR TERRITORY 🔥🔥"" is an appeal to emotions fallacy because it tries to evoke a sense of nationalistic pride and excitement by using strong language and exclamation marks.

2. Appeal to Tradition: The tweet by SKFilmsOfficial, ""Enjoy the fun-filled drama, action and romance this Eid in #KisiKaBhaiKisiKiJaan Book your tickets now and watch our film on April 21st."" is an appeal to tradition fallacy because it encourages people to continue the tradition of watching movies on Eid without providing any valid reasons for doing so.

- Use of phrases like ""Your love has made KBKJ a worldwide hit"" and ""World is our territory.""
- Criticism of government officials like PM Modi and NSA Doval in relation to the Pulwama attack.

Post: RT @IndoPac_Info #UK likely to become involved if a #China #Taiwan war breaks out ""If I'm China, I probably have to take out the US forces in Japan & prevent regional support for the US, which means Australia & maybe the Philippines & that could easily bring the UK too."" https://t.co/nNDXx37PI6 https://t.co/pR4k5PCcYo
Fallacy: Appeal to Force
Explanation: This post implies that the UK would easily get involved in a war between China and Taiwan, based on the actions of China. This appeal to force suggests that the UK's involvement is inevitable if certain actions are taken.
Example: ""If you don't do what I say, you'll regret it.""

2. Post: RT @hourly_cookie What’s everyones favorite cookie run NPC(s)?
Fallacy: Bandwagon
Explanation: This post is appealing to the popularity of certain cookie run NPCs by asking for people's favorites, suggesting that certain NPCs are more popular or preferable than others based on the opinions of the majority.
Example: ""Everyone is doing it, so you should too.""

3. Post: RT @hourly_cookie This hours NPC is, the Blueberry Birds! “This Kingdom looks safe! I'll live here from now on! Chirp!” #cookierun #cookierunkingdom #cookierunovenbreak https://t.co/cvlX5bhEOA
Fallacy: Anthropomorphism
Explanation: This post attributes human characteristics, such as speaking and decision-making, to non-human entities (Blueberry Birds). This can create a false sense of empathy or understanding towards the birds.
Example: ""The trees whispered to me as I walked through the forest.""

4. Post: RT @hourly_cookie This hours NPC is, Premier Custard Cream Cookie! “Where is Pure Vanilla Cookie…” #cookierun #cookierunkingdom #cookierunovenbreak https://t.co/Bl0YcnFu5F
Fallacy: False Dilemma
Explanation: This post presents a false dilemma by suggesting that there are only two options: either Premier Custard Cream Cookie or Pure Vanilla Cookie. This oversimplifies the situation and limits the choices to only two possibilities.
Example: ""You're either with us or against us.""

5. Post: RT @hourly_cookie This hours NPC is, Aurora Candy Cookie! “Aurora speaking. Sugarcloud Express, report. Has there been a malfunction?” #cookierun #cookierunkingdom #cookierunovenbreak https://t.co/c9SQ7OD08X
Fallacy: Appeal to Consequence
Explanation: This post implies that something has gone wrong or may go wrong (malfunction) and appeals to the potential negative consequences of the situation. It suggests that actions need to be taken to prevent or address the consequences.
Example: ""If you don't want to fail the class, you better study hard.""","The culture implied in these posts is the gaming community or fans of the mobile game Cookierun.
