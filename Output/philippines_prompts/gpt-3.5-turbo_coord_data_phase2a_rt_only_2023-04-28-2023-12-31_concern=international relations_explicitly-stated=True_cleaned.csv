Example: ""RT @Offladipurush Your devotion has fueled this epic journey, and we're grateful for each and every one of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è Jai Shri Ram üôè Book your tickets on: https://t.co/Ff1IP5kCp6 #Adipurush now in cinemas ‚ú® #Prabhas @omraut #SaifAliKhan @kritisanon @mesunnysingh #BhushanKumar #KrishanKumar‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TikxYSLdhj""

Explanation: This tweet appeals to emotions by using words like ""epic journey,"" ""grateful,"" and ""devotion,"" in order to create a positive association with the movie ""Adipurush.""

Jai Shri Ram üôè https://t.co/0gHImE23yj #Prabhas @omraut‚Ä¶ https://t.co/EOCb2GroSQ""

Explanation: This tweet appeals to the popularity of the movie ""Adipurush"" by highlighting its impressive box office numbers in an attempt to influence others to watch the movie.

3. Appeal to Tradition:

Explanation: This tweet appeals to tradition by using phrases like ""feel the anticipation rise,"" ""the epic saga,"" and ""Jai Shri Ram,"" to create a sense of excitement and familiarity with the movie ""Adipurush,"" thereby encouraging people to support it.

This can contribute to a global trend of arms races, heightened tensions, and potential conflicts among nations.","The remedy for the problem of prioritizing militarization and military spending, as mentioned in these tweets, is to advocate for a shift in budget allocations towards areas such as social welfare, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This would help reduce the arms race, lower tensions among nations, and minimize the risk of conflicts. Additionally, promoting global cooperation and diplomacy over military power can also contribute to a more peaceful and stable international relations environment.","Metaphors related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets:
1. Problem: The problem of militarization and military spending is indirectly referenced in the tweet that lists military spending figures for different countries. Metaphorically, the arms race and prioritization of defense budgets among nations can be seen as a global game of ""chess"" or ""checkmate"" where each country is making strategic moves to gain power and advantage.

2. Cause: The cause of prioritizing military spending over other societal needs is not explicitly mentioned in the tweets. However, the metaphor of ""arrogance"" and ""corruption"" used in one of the tweets to describe a political party's behavior can suggest that the decision-making process regarding budget allocations may be influenced by self-interest and lack of concern for the welfare of the people.

3. Remedy: The remedy for shifting budget allocations towards social welfare, education, healthcare, and infrastructure is not explicitly mentioned in the tweets related to international relations. However, the idea of promoting global cooperation, diplomacy, and peaceful relations among nations can be metaphorically represented as a ""path to peace"" or ""bridge to cooperation"" where countries come together to work towards common goals and resolve conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding.","Catchphrases related to the problem of militarization, military spending, and arms races stated in the posts:
1. ""Military spending in 2022""

5. ""Chinese constructions along the Uttarakhand border""
6. ""Checkmate for the current Pak establishment""

Catchphrases related to the cause of prioritizing military spending over other areas:
1. ""Record-breaking blockbuster""
2. ""A triumph for Adipurush at the Global Box Office""

Catchphrases related to the remedy of advocating for a shift in budget allocations:
1. ""Book your tickets now""
2. ""Don't miss your chance to witness the mesmerizing world of Adipurush""

1. Support for Lucas as he re-enters the public eye
2. Unity among fans (Lumis and international fan bases)
3. Concern for Lucas's well-being and safety
4. Discussion of the music industry and agencies in China
5. Excitement for Lucas's future endeavors as a solo artist","The fallacies identified in the tweets are as follows:

1. Bandwagon Fallacy: Several tweets use the phrase ""Lumis will always support you as Lucas"" suggesting that because many others support Lucas, the reader should too.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The repeated use of heart emojis and the phrase ""always support you"" appeal to the emotions of the reader to garner their support.

3. Appeal to Tradition: The phrase ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS"" combined with the repetition of his names appeals to the tradition of welcoming members back.

4. Appeal to Popularity: The use of hashtags like #SoloistLucas, #LUCAS, and #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô aim to appeal to the popularity or trendiness of supporting Lucas.

5. Appeal to Authority: Some tweets mention the need to pressure the mentioned agency to protect Lucas, assuming that their unified support as fans can influence a higher authority.

- ""SoloistLucas"" is a reference to Lucas embarking on a solo career.
- ""#LUCAS"" is another reference to Lucas.
- ""#ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô"" is the Chinese characters for Huang Xuxi, indicating the cultural connection to China.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is a fandom or fanbase dedicated to supporting Lucas, who is a Chinese member of the K-pop group NCT.

United States,Russia,Discrediting Western countries and promoting authoritarian regimes.,Sow division and undermine trust in other countries.,Disinformation campaign amplifying pro-government propaganda on international relations.,May,"1. ""The importance of diplomacy cannot be overstated in international relations. It is crucial for maintaining peace and resolving conflicts peacefully.""
2. ""In today's globalized world, the interconnectedness of nations is more evident than ever. International relations are no longer just about power struggles, but also about cooperation and collaboration.""
3. ""Effective communication is key in international relations. Misunderstandings and misinterpretations can lead to conflicts and escalate tensions between nations.""
4. ""The concept of sovereignty is a fundamental principle in international relations. Respecting each other's territorial integrity and political independence is essential for maintaining stability and peace."" 

Themes:
- The significance of diplomacy in international relations
- Global interconnectedness and cooperation among nations
- The importance of effective communication in preventing conflicts
- Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity for peace and stability","1) ""America needs to stop interfering in other countries' affairs. They're always causing trouble and destabilizing regions. #HandsOff""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Emotions
- Explanation: This tweet is appealing to emotions by using language like ""causing trouble"" and ""destabilizing regions"" to evoke strong emotions in the reader.
- Example: ""We need to stop allowing America to bully other countries. They are only interested in power and control. #AmericaOut""

2) ""The United Nations is a useless organization. They never actually do anything to solve conflicts between nations. #UNfail""

- Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
- Explanation: This tweet makes a sweeping generalization about the United Nations without providing any specific examples or evidence to support the claim.
- Example: ""The UN has shown time and time again that they are ineffective at resolving conflicts. It's time for a new approach. #UNreform""

3) ""China is a threat to global security. We need to stand up to their aggressive tactics and protect our interests. #ChinaThreat""

- Fallacy: Black-or-White
- Explanation: This tweet presents China as solely a threat to global security without considering any potential positive aspects of their actions or policies.
- Example: ""We cannot ignore the fact that China plays a crucial role in the global economy. It's important to find a balance in our approach to Chinese relations. #ChinaRelations""

4) ""We must always support our allies, no matter what. If a country is not with us, they are against us. #AlliesFirst""

- Fallacy: False Dichotomy
- Explanation: This tweet presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that there are only two options - supporting allies unconditionally or being against them. It ignores the possibility of nuanced relationships with allies.
- Example: ""It's important to consider the complexities of international relations and not view alliances in such black-and-white terms. #NuancedAlliances""","1. ""We need to strengthen our alliances and work together to combat global challenges. United we stand, divided we fall. #internationalrelations #teamwork #diplomacy""

5. ""Globalization has connected countries like never before, creating complex relationships that require careful navigation. #globalization #internationalrelations""

Post 1 (""The United Nations plays a crucial role in facilitating communication and cooperation between countries. #internationalrelations #UN"") uses an Explain tactic by providing specific details on the topic of international relations, specifically highlighting the role of the United Nations in facilitating communication and cooperation between countries. It elaborates on the importance of this organization in the context of international relations.","1. ""Our partnership with country X has opened doors for diplomacy and collaboration across borders.

5. ""The recent trade agreement between country C and country D highlights the benefits of cooperation and open dialogue in international relations. Exciting times ahead for economic growth and development.""

3. ""The world is more interconnected than ever before, highlighting the importance of strong international relations. Let's continue to foster positive relationships with other nations for a better future."" 

All three posts use an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic-group to continue focusing on international relations. They emphasize the importance of diplomatic solutions, peace, and positive relationships among nations. These posts aim to encourage discussion and action in support of enhancing international relations.","Post 1: ""Global cooperation and diplomacy are crucial for maintaining peace and stability in the world.

Post 4: ""It's time to put an end to unfair trade practices that harm our economy. We must hold other countries accountable and stand up for our own interests in the global market. #fairtrade #internationalrelations""

Post 2 uses a Distort tactic by emphasizing the idea of ""America first"" and prioritizing solely the interests of the United States in international relations. This distorts the main message of cooperation and mutual understanding between countries.","1. ""Our country's foreign policy is a complete disaster. We need leaders who will prioritize diplomacy and cooperation instead of aggression and hostility. #InternationalRelations #VoteForChange""

Post 3: ""Did you know that pineapple on pizza is actually a controversial topic? Some people love it, while others hate it. What do you think?""

In this case, Post 1 is using a Distract tactic by discussing a completely different topic (pizza) that is irrelevant to the discussion of international relations. This post serves to divert attention away from the main topic and can be seen as an attempt to steer the conversation in a different direction. Post 3 also employs the Distract tactic by bringing up the controversial topic of pineapple on pizza, which has nothing to do with international relations.

Election interference

Pushing false political agendas",The political goal is to discredit the CPC and shift focus away from accusations of potential Chinese interference in Canadian politics by emphasizing potential CPC wrongdoing and manipulation.,Information operation with a narrative focused on the Conservative Party of Canada spreading disinformation about alleged foreign interference to manipulate elections.,January,"Major themes from these posts include:
1. Criticism of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) for various actions and tactics.
2. Accusations of interference and manipulation, particularly from Russia and China.
3. Concerns about election interference and misinformation.
4. Condemnation of fabricated scandals and fake outrage.
5. Calls for accountability, integrity, and public inquiry.
6. Criticism of specific CPC leaders and their actions.
7. Claims of right-wing political vandalism and toxic behavior.
8. Discussion of polling integrity and bias.
9. Analysis of financial donations and potential implications.

Example: ""Like I've always said, simply keep Pierre Poilievre talking. The more he talks, the more he craters any chance at a CPC victory. The lies piled on bullshit piled on plain old whining reveal who and what he is.""

2. Appeal to Emotions: Emotive language is used to evoke a strong emotional response, rather than presenting logical arguments.
Example: ""But because the 'Chinese interference' op got traction, Con owned #cdnmedia, is continuing to try to whip up some way of smearing the LPC government with flimsy evidence & allegations.""

3. Sweeping Generalization: Stereotyping or making generalizations about a whole group based on the actions of a few individuals.
Example: ""I've lost track of the nothing burgers these fascist assholes rage on about. The 'swingset scandal' and Poilievre's 'Lakeside mansion' are just two of them. Fuck the CPC.""

- Marcos being a celebrity crush for some individuals
- Marcos participating in meet and greet events
- Marcos' involvement with Swatch Argentina and other brands","1. Appeal to Authority: The tweet ""Meet and Greet con Marcos"" could be seen as an appeal to authority fallacy if Marcos is not actually an authoritative figure on the topic of international relations. An example post associated with this fallacy would be: ""Come meet Marcos and learn about international relations from the expert himself!""

2. Ad Hominem: The tweet ""Omg hi marcos"" could be seen as an ad hominem fallacy if it focuses on the person (Marcos) rather than the actual topic of international relations. An example post associated with this fallacy would be: ""Marcos is so cute, I don't care what he says about international relations!""

3. Red Herring: The tweet ""Marcos ginocchio - what is love"" could be seen as a red herring fallacy if it diverts attention away from the topic of international relations. An example post associated with this fallacy would be: ""Forget international relations, let's talk about Marcos and love!""

4. Appeal to Popularity: The tweet ""27K YOUTUBE 6,7K TWITCH MARCOS EN FDJ"" could be seen as an appeal to popularity fallacy if it suggests that Marcos's popularity determines his knowledge or expertise in international relations. An example post associated with this fallacy would be: ""Marcos has so many followers, he must be an expert on international relations!""

5. False Analogy: The tweet ""Marcos para Sarkany"" could be seen as a false analogy fallacy if it equates Marcos with a brand (Sarkany) in a way that is not logically sound. An example post associated with this fallacy would be: ""Just like Sarkany shoes are stylish, Marcos is stylish in international relations!""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest that they are part of a fan group or community related to Marcos Ginocchio, potentially a social media influencer or celebrity. The use of hashtags like #MarcosGinocchio, references to specific events or appearances by Marcos, and mention of his collaborations with brands like Sarkany and Swatch indicate an in-group culture centered around following and supporting Marcos. The posts also reference specific actions or appearances by Marcos, such as being in FDJ or attending a meet and greet, further reinforcing the sense of a close-knit community of fans.

Recruitment of new players and transfers for the Arkansas Razorbacks football team
2. Updates on current and potential players for the Arkansas Razorbacks basketball team
3. Honoring former players and coaches associated with the Arkansas Razorbacks
4. Public reaction and sentiment towards events and news related to the Arkansas Razorbacks
5. Controversial opinions on healthcare and government policies","1. Appeal to Authority: In the tweet by Eric Musselman, stating ""Great first night with the 2023-2024 @RazorbackMBB squad!"" and including the hashtag #WPS, is an example of appeal to authority. Musselman's position as the head coach is used as authority to promote the team and create excitement amongst fans.

2. Appeal to Tradition: In the tweet by Alyssa Orange, mentioning fans leaving flowers outside Gate 14 of Razorback Stadium to honor Ryan Mallett, is an example of appeal to tradition. Honoring past players and traditions is a common practice in sports, and in this case, it serves to evoke nostalgia and loyalty from fans.

3. Ad Populum: In the tweet by K_Money4real, stating ""10 straight nights on the road in a hotel.. these kids just need some rest and home cooking.. They will be ready for the real action next week #WPSüêó"", is an example of appeal to the masses. By using language that appeals to the emotions and fatigue of the players, the tweet aims to generate sympathy and support from fans.

4. Red Herring: The tweet by DarrigoMelanie, discussing health insurance companies and Medicare, is an example of a red herring. The tweet introduces a new and unrelated topic (healthcare and politics) to distract from the original discussion about international relations.

5. Bandwagon: In the tweet by OtisKirk23, stating ""Are you watching?!?! Good stuff airing right now! #WPS"", is an example of bandwagon. The tweet encourages viewers to join in and watch the content, using the popularity of the topic to attract more viewers.

6. Straw Man: In the tweet by TreyBiddy, discussing the return of Devo Davis and Eric Musselman's reaction, is an example of straw man. By emphasizing the positive sentiment towards the player and coach, the tweet constructs a distorted version of the argument to strengthen their position.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts are centered around the University of Arkansas Razorbacks sports teams. The hashtags #Arkansas, #Razorbacks, #Hogs, and #WPS (which likely stands for ""Woo Pig Sooie,"" a popular cheer for Arkansas Razorbacks fans) are consistently used in the tweets. The sponsored mentions of Dr. Pepper also suggest a partnership with the University of Arkansas athletic department.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is that of University of Arkansas Razorbacks sports fans, particularly those interested in football and basketball. The use of specific team hashtags and references to players, transfers, and recruiting indicate a close-knit community of fans who closely follow and support the University of Arkansas sports programs.","- Razorbacks

Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in the tweet about Sugar Swan as the language used is dramatic and emotional, appealing to the reader's emotions rather than presenting factual information. This fallacy can manipulate the audience's feelings to sway their opinions.

Example: ""HEROS, YOU'VE SAVED ME, AND THIS WORLD‚Ä¶""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists in the tweet about Royal Gardener as the character is attacking another character based on their personal characteristics rather than focusing on the actual issue at hand. This fallacy is a type of personal attack that diverts attention away from the argument.

Example: ""Princess or not, I won‚Äôt let such a dirty creature step inside my beloved garden!""

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy exists in the tweet about Priest Cookie as it mentions the founding of the Vanilla Kingdom and uses historical context to validate the current situation. This fallacy assumes that something is better or correct because it's traditional.

Example: ""On this historic day, our sovereign, Pure Vanilla Cookie, has declared the founding of the Vanilla Kingdom.""

4. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists in the tweet about Potion Merchant Cookie as it presents the character as an authority figure selling potions. This fallacy relies on the credibility of the speaker rather than the strength of the argument.

Example: ""Potions! Get your potions! Wyvern Tear Tinctures, Troll Toenail Solutions, we carry everything you need!""

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists in the tweet because the user @WealthMen86 is attempting to convince others to buy #OGGYINU by claiming that CZ (potentially referring to the CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange) said the bullrun will start in China. However, just because someone in a position of authority or expertise says something does not necessarily make it true or a good investment.

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in the tweet because @WealthMen86 is trying to persuade others to buy #OGGYINU by implying that many others are already doing so and they should not be left behind. 
Example post: ""Join the trend and buy #OGGYINU, don't be left behind when the bullrun starts in China!""

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in the tweet because @WealthMen86 is using fear (""Don't be fool"") and the desire for financial security to convince others to buy #OGGYINU.

6. International relations and diplomacy with Azerbaijan and Armenia, particularly in relation to Aliyev's regime and actions.","Ad Hominem: The fallacy of Ad Hominem occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than the argument itself. For example, in the tweet by @ANCA_DC ""Monitoring while people die. That's not satisfactory to me."" - @SenatorMenendez, pressing @JoeBiden's Ambassador to Azerbaijan nominee, Mark Libby, to pivot from the Administration's passive response to Aliyev's blockade and aggression, the focus is on criticizing the nominee rather than addressing the issue.

Appeal to Emotions: The fallacy of Appeal to Emotions occurs when the speaker tries to manipulate the audience's emotions to win support for their argument. For example, in the tweet by @bulutuzay_ ""What‚Äôs required is immediate sanctions on the Aliyev dictatorship & an end to the US military aid to Azerbaijan."" appeals to the emotions of the audience by highlighting the suffering caused by Aliyev's regime.

Appeal to Authority: The fallacy of Appeal to Authority occurs when the speaker relies on the opinion of an authority figure as evidence for their argument. For example, in the tweet by @simonforco ""BREAKING As Azerbaijan and Armenia meet in DC, the Aliyev regime launches military attacks on two fronts in Nagorno-Karabakh"" relies on the authority of a news source to support their argument.

False Dichotomy: The fallacy of False Dichotomy occurs when the speaker presents only two options as if they are the only possibilities, ignoring other potential options.

The language used implies a shared understanding of the political complexities and historical conflicts in the region, particularly focusing on the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan, specifically with regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. References to terms such as ""Artsakh,"" ""Azerbaijani terror,"" ""Ethnic cleansing,"" and ""Genocide"" suggest a pro-Armenian perspective that prioritizes the protection of Armenian interests and rights in the face of perceived aggression from Azerbaijan.

3. ""International relations can be a tricky game of balancing national interests with international cooperation.""

Theme: Balancing sovereignty and global cooperation in international relations.","1. Tweet: ""The United States should just bomb all their enemies. It's the only way to keep us safe.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Force
Explanation: This tweet is using the threat of force to persuade others to agree with the argument.

Example: ""If you don't support military intervention in other countries, you must not care about our national security.""

2. Tweet: ""Everyone knows that the United Nations is useless and should be abolished.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Common Belief

- The cultural cue being used here is the hashtag #USA, which implies a sense of patriotism and support for the United States military. This post is likely from someone who identifies with American nationalism and supports the country's military efforts.

2. ""Standing in solidarity with our allies in the fight for global security #NATO""

- The in-group language used here is the mention of NATO, which stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This implies a group of countries that have a mutual defense agreement and work together on international security issues. The person posting this is likely part of a community that values international cooperation and alliances.

3. ""We need to prioritize diplomacy over aggression in our foreign policy #peace""

- The cultural cue being used here is the hashtag #peace, which signifies a belief in peaceful resolutions to conflicts and a focus on diplomacy. This post is likely from someone who values peace and non-violent solutions in international relations.","1. Diplomatic language

Post 5: ""Human rights should always be a top priority in discussions of international relations. We must hold countries accountable for their actions. #humanrights""

Post 4: ""Our current international relations are weak and ineffective. It's time for a change in our approach to diplomacy and foreign policy.""

Post 4 uses a Distort tactic by altering the main message of the topic. While the other posts focus on the importance of strong international relations and diplomacy, post 4 presents a negative and distorted view claiming that current international relations are weak and ineffective.","1. ""The United States must take a stronger stance against countries that violate human rights.

4. ""The betrayal of trust between allies is a concerning trend in today's international relations landscape. We must work towards rebuilding partnerships based on mutual respect and cooperation. #allies #internationalrelations""

Post 3 uses a Dismay tactic by emphasizing the negative emotions of being appalled and calling attention to the cycle of violence and conflict in the Middle East, which can elicit sadness or anger in readers.","Post 1: ""Just had the best sushi for lunch, definitely recommend trying it out if you're in the area! #foodie #yum""

Post 4: ""The recent trade agreements between countries have really been benefitting both sides. It's great to see cooperation on a global scale. #internationalrelations""

In this scenario, Posts 1 and 3 both use the Distract tactic by discussing irrelevant topics (sushi and TV shows) instead of focusing on international relations.

Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
Explanation: The post is appealing to the authority of Hillary Clinton and Chrystya Freeland in discussing the war in Ukraine, implying that their opinions or actions are inherently valid due to their positions.
Example: ""Hillary Clinton and Chrystya Freeland are experts in international relations, so they must know what they are talking about regarding the war in Ukraine.""
