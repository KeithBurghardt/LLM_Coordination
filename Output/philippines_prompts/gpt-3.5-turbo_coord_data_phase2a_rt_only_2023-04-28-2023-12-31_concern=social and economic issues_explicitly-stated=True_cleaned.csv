Indonesia.,Indonesia.,The type of political goal for the posts: Disinformation and manipulation.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to spread misinformation and distract the audience from legitimate social and economic issues by promoting explicit and inappropriate content.,Spam promoting adult content.,There is no information operation for these tweets.,"The major themes from these posts are objectification, exploitation, and promotion of sexual content for financial gain. The posts promote and advertise explicit videos for a fee, objectifying women and exploiting their bodies for profit. The use of hashtags like #abgbugil and #ngentot also indicate the promotion of sexual content, which can contribute to societal issues related to the objectification of women and the normalization of exploitative practices.","The fallacies that exist in the tweets are Appeal to Emotions, Appeal to Authority, and Bandwagon.

1. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets use emotional language and imagery to attract attention. For example, phrases like ""memekbasah"" and ""ngentotmemek"" are meant to evoke strong emotions in the audience.

2. Appeal to Authority: The tweets use the strategy of associating themselves with a VIP group to lend credibility to their content. This is an appeal to authority fallacy, as it implies that being part of a VIP group makes the content more reliable or valuable.

3. Bandwagon: The tweets create a sense of exclusivity and belonging by inviting people to join the VIP group. This is a bandwagon fallacy, as it suggests that being part of the group is desirable simply because others are doing it.

- Example: ""All teenagers are irresponsible and should have their allowances taken away.""

2. Tweet: ""My friend's cousin's neighbor lost their job because of immigrants taking all the jobs. We need stricter immigration policies to protect our economy.""

   - This is an appeal to ignorance fallacy because it makes assumptions about Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party without providing any concrete evidence.

3. Straw Man: Tweet by @Dred_Tory - ""I'm really looking forward to hearing constructive suggestions about a foreign meddling inquiry from the CPC leader who supported a massively foreign-funded Ottawa occupation and border blockade inspired by MAGA, QAnon, Fox News, and other species of foreign far-right idiocy.""
   - This is a straw man fallacy because it misrepresents the actions of the CPC leader in order to attack his credibility and distract from the actual issue being discussed.

4. False Cause: Tweet by @CaptainDick12 - ""China working to get Canadians 'at each other's throats': researcher. The negativity created by the CPC agenda to divide Canadians and pit us against each other plays right into the agenda of these groups to undermine democracy.""
   - This is a false cause fallacy because it incorrectly links the actions of the CPC to China's alleged attempts to create discord among Canadians without providing any evidence of a causal relationship.

5. Appeal to Emotions: Tweet by @67Capt_Canuck - ""Yes! It is high time Canadians woke up - no pun intended - to what Harper and Poilievre have done to radicalize their 2004 CPC. The CPC is now a Trumper Republican neo-fascist movement.""
   - This is an appeal to emotions fallacy because it uses strong language and emotional terms to evoke a negative emotional response towards the CPC without providing factual evidence to support the claims.","1. The use of ""CPC"" in several tweets refers to the Conservative Party of Canada, indicating an in-group language used by those who are familiar with Canadian political parties.
2. References to Pierre Poilievre, Harper, and the idea of the CPC being a ""neo-fascist movement"" imply a left-leaning or liberal perspective in the tweets, contrasting with the conservative viewpoints of the Conservative Party of Canada.
3. The mention of China, foreign interference, and Canada's relationship with other countries suggests a focus on international relations and national security as part of the cultural cues in these tweets.
4. The use of terms like ""neoliberal authoritarian fascist"" and ""Trumper Republican neo-fascist"" implies a critical view of right-wing political ideologies and policies, further highlighting the cultural perspective of the individuals behind these tweets.","- Criminal Code

United States,China,Influencing public opinion.,The political goal of the information operation is to promote anti-CCP sentiment and advocate for democratic and freedom movements in China.,Information operation aimed at portraying the Chinese Communist Party as a threat to democracy and national security through various allegations and claims.,May 2023,"Based on the provided tweets, the major themes include:
1. Concerns about Chinese aggression and influence in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. Calls for the US and other Western countries to decouple economically from China.
3. Allegations of Chinese interference in US politics and elections.
4. Criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and calls for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.
5. Discussions about the CCP's proxies and their actions in the US.
6. Advocacy for the release of Miles Guo, who is seen as innocent.
7. Warnings about the threats posed by the CCP to democracy, national security, and individual freedoms.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets make use of emotional language and alarming statements to evoke fear and concern about the actions of the CCP and their potential impact on democracy and national security.

Example post: ""JUST IN: Major warning signs out of CHINA following Blinken‚Äôs visit.. The CCP‚Äôs control of The Biden Administration an existential threat to democracy and national security. RT if you think it‚Äôs time to arrest Hunter and STOP pussyfooting to the CCP.""

2. Appeal to Consequence: The tweets try to persuade the audience by appealing to the potential negative consequences of not taking action against the CCP, such as loss of sovereignty, democracy, and control by the CCP.

Example post: ""üßêShould the UK sign into this ‚Äúnew treaty‚Äù?? ‚ö†Ô∏èWe would have lost our sovereignty and put the citizens into great danger of unconstitutional control by an unelected body called W.H.O., not to say, by the power behind the scene, the CCP!üò∂""

Example post: ""Rep. Cole: Communist China does not play by the rules!! What will happen when Evils Dictator win the games??? Are you ready to being enslaved???""

4. Loaded Language: The tweets contain language that is highly emotive and biased, aiming to influence the audience's perception of the CCP and their actions in a particular direction.

Appeal to Emotions: The first tweet by @PennilessScribe uses emotionally charged language such as ""ragged edge of survival,"" ""swarms,"" and ""city of the dead"" to evoke fear and suspense in the reader, encouraging them to click on the link to find out more about the story. This fallacy exists to manipulate the reader's emotions rather than provide logical reasoning.

2. Appeal to Ignorance: The second tweet by @PennilessScribe states that a new threat is rising out of the swarms, implying that the only way to survive is through strength and courage. This fallacy exists by suggesting that because the threat is unknown, the only way to combat it is through bravery and determination.

3. Appeal to Tradition: The tweet by @MELLOWCELLO1 is appealing to the tradition of dedicating music to a favorite bear at Katmai National Park. This fallacy exists by implying that because something has been done in the past, it should continue to be done in the present.

4. Appeal to Authority: The tweet by @AuthorMBTosi mentions that despite a treaty being signed, the battle for indigenous lands was just beginning. This fallacy exists by presenting the author as an authority figure on the subject, thereby lending credibility to their statement.

5. Bandwagon: The tweet by @31773Lieberman talks about saving bees and how small actions can make a big difference, appealing to the idea of joining a popular cause.

Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition Wisdom
Explanation: This tweet appeals to the idea that discussing British Imperialism, Colonization, and Colonialism is important because it is a traditional issue that has affected many regions. It implies that focusing on this topic is valuable because it is part of a historical tradition.

Example post: ""According to Warren Buffett, investing in traditional stocks is the safest way to secure your financial future. Don't be misled by other options, follow his advice and invest in stocks.""

2. False Cause: This fallacy exists in the post because it suggests that buying OGGYINU will secure your future before the bull run starts, without providing any concrete evidence or logical reasoning for this claim. 
Example post: ""I wore my lucky socks yesterday and my favorite sports team won. Clearly, wearing these socks brings good luck and leads to victory.""

3. Bandwagon: This fallacy exists in the post because it implies that everyone is buying OGGYINU and it is the popular choice to secure one's future before the bull run starts. 
Example post: ""Join the thousands of satisfied customers who have already purchased our product and experienced amazing results. Don't miss out on this opportunity to be part of the trend!""

4. Appeal to Fear: This fallacy exists in the post because it uses fear-mongering language like ""Don't be fool"" and implies that if you don't buy OGGYINU, you are at risk of missing out on securing your future before the bull run starts.

""Poor people just need to work harder and stop relying on handouts from the government. If they would just take more personal responsibility, they wouldn't be in their current situation.""

- This post contains the fallacy of oversimplification, by reducing the complex issue of poverty to simply a matter of individual effort. It ignores systemic barriers and inequalities that contribute to poverty.

Example of post: ""If you just work harder, you wouldn't be struggling financially. Take some personal responsibility for your situation.""

2. ""The majority of people support this policy, so it must be the right decision. We should listen to the will of the people.""

- This post contains the fallacy of appeal to popularity, assuming that the popularity of an idea determines its validity. It neglects to consider that popular opinion is not always a reliable indicator of what is right or moral.

Example of post: ""Everyone is in favor of this policy, so it must be the best choice for our society.""

3. ""I don't see why we need to raise the minimum wage. If businesses were forced to pay workers more, they would just end up cutting jobs to make up the difference.""

- This post contains the fallacy of false dilemma, presenting a situation as if there are only two possible outcomes when in reality there could be other solutions to address the issue of low wages.

Example of post: ""If we raise the minimum wage, businesses will have no choice but to lay off workers to stay afloat.""

4. ""Your arguments about income inequality are invalid because you yourself are wealthy and have never experienced poverty firsthand.""

- This post contains the fallacy of ad hominem- circumstantial, attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the actual points being made. It tries to discredit the argument based on the speaker's personal circumstances rather than the evidence presented.

""All rich people are greedy and selfish. It's just a fact. They only care about themselves and their money.""

   Fallacy: Biased Generalizing
   Explanation: This statement makes a sweeping generalization about all rich people based on the actions of a few.
   Example post: ""I heard about a millionaire who cheated his employees. That just proves my point that all rich people are unethical.""

2. ""If you don't support raising the minimum wage, you must not care about low-income workers and their well-being.""

   Fallacy: False Dichotomy
   Explanation: This statement presents only two options when there could be other reasons for not supporting raising the minimum wage.
   Example post: ""Either you want to help low-income workers or you want them to struggle. There's no in-between.""

3. ""Studies have shown that 90% of people support this new social program. So it must be a good idea.""

   Fallacy: Appeal to Popularity
   Explanation: This statement argues that something is good or right because it is popular.
   Example post: ""Everyone else is in favor of this new policy, so there's no reason to question its effectiveness.""

4. ""Don't listen to those experts; they are just out of touch with the real world. Trust me, I know what's best for the economy.""

   Fallacy: Slippery Slope

   Example post: ""If we don't pass this tax increase, our economy will collapse, and we will all be living in poverty.""","1. ""The struggle is real out here in these streets. Gotta hustle to make it in this economy. #grind""

These phrases are commonly used in urban, hip-hop culture to describe the challenges and difficulties faced in low-income, marginalized communities.

2. ""The 1% keep getting richer while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet. It's time for a revolution. #justiceforall""

- The cultural cue in this post is the reference to the ""1%"" which is a term commonly used in social justice movements to describe the wealthiest individuals and corporations who hold a disproportionate amount of wealth and power.
