9. Criticism of individual Tory politicians 
10. Calls for accountability and trials for Tory misconduct.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotionally charged language to convey their message, such as calling the Tories ""bad"" and ""corrupt.""

Example: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in townüé∂""

2. Ad Hominem: The posts attack the character of the Tories by calling them names like ""Cuntocracy"" and using derogatory language. This fallacy exists because it undermines the credibility of the argument by focusing on personal attacks.

3. Ad Populum: The posts use hashtags like #ToriesOut, #GTTO, and #EnoughIsEnough to appeal to the masses and create a sense of unity against the Tories. This fallacy exists because it relies on popular opinion rather than logical argumentation.

Terms like ""Oligarchy guy n gal,"" ""Cuntocracy,"" ""TorySewageParty,"" and ""ToryMisconductTrials"" reflect a belief that the Tories are corrupt and self-serving. 

The use of these cultural cues and in-group language signals a shared political ideology among the users of these tweets, which is likely a mix of left-wing, progressive, and anti-establishment beliefs.

Tweet: ""All politicians are corrupt and can't be trusted to manage our public services.""
Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization
Explanation: This tweet makes a broad generalization about all politicians without providing any specific evidence or examples to support the claim.
Example: ""All teachers are lazy and don't care about educating our children.""

2. Tweet: ""If you don't support increasing funding for public services, you must not care about the well-being of our community.""
Fallacy: Ad Hominem
Explanation: This tweet attacks the character or motives of anyone who doesn't support the speaker's position, rather than addressing the actual argument or reasons for opposing increased funding.
Example: ""If you don't agree with me, you must be selfish and uncaring.""

3. Tweet: ""It's common knowledge that public services are poorly managed and wasteful.""
Fallacy: Appeal to Common Belief
Explanation: This tweet appeals to the idea that something is true simply because it is commonly believed, without providing any evidence to support the claim.
Example: ""Everyone knows that eating carrots makes you see better.""

4. Tweet: ""The government has always provided public services, so it should continue to do so without question.""

5. Tweet: ""If you don't want to invest in improving public services, you must not value the future of our society.""
Fallacy: Appeal to Emotions
Explanation: This tweet attempts to manipulate the reader's emotions by suggesting that not supporting investment in public services reflects a lack of care or concern for the future.

Language motifs mentioned in the posts about public services are:
- Accessible
- Investing 
- Quality
- Efficient","Post 1: ""Public services are crucial for a functioning society. We need to invest in them to ensure that everyone has access to essential services like healthcare and education.""

Post 2: ""It's a shame that public services are being constantly underfunded and understaffed. We need to support our public servants who work tirelessly to keep our communities running smoothly.""

Post 3: ""Did you know that some countries have successfully implemented universal healthcare and education systems? It's time for us to consider these models to improve our own public services."" 

Post 3 is using an Engage tactic by bringing up a related but relevant topic of universal healthcare and education systems from other countries. This tactic can help spark discussion and provide a fresh perspective on the issue of public services.","Post 1: ""Public services are essential for the well-being of our communities. From healthcare to education to public transportation, we need to prioritize funding and support for these vital services.""

Post 2: ""Public services impact all of us, from the moment we are born to the end of our lives. It's time we invest in building robust and efficient systems that serve all members of our society.""

Post 3: ""Access to quality public services should not be determined by someone's zip code or income level. We must work towards creating equitable and accessible services for all."" 

Post 4: ""Public services save lives and improve livelihoods. It's imperative that we continue to advocate for stronger funding and resources for these essential services.""

Post 5: ""We need to recognize the value of public services in promoting social cohesion and economic growth. Let's invest in the infrastructure and workforce needed to ensure these services are sustainable and effective."" 

Among these posts, Post 3 utilizes an Explain tactic by elaborating on the importance of creating equitable and accessible public services for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or location. The post goes beyond simply stating the importance of public services and provides details on the specific issue of inequity in access to these services.","1. ""Public services are crucial for providing essential resources to communities and ensuring equal access for all. Let's continue to support and invest in them for a better future for all #publicservices #equality""

2. ""Just witnessed our local public service workers going above and beyond to help those in need. So grateful for their dedication and hard work #heroes #publicservices""

3. ""Thrilled to see improvements being made to our public transportation system, making it more accessible and efficient for everyone. Way to go, public services! #progress #publictransport""

4. ""Public services play a key role in creating a strong society where everyone has the support they need to thrive. Let's celebrate and appreciate all those who work tirelessly to make it happen #community #publicservices""

Post 2 uses an Excite tactic by expressing gratitude and admiration for public service workers, eliciting positive emotions of joy and excitement.","Post 1: ""Public services are vital for a thriving society. We need to ensure they are adequately funded and accessible to all. #publicservices #support""

Post 2: ""Did you know that public services cover a wide range of essential services, such as healthcare, education, transportation, and more? Let's continue to prioritize funding for these crucial services. #publicservices #priorities""

Post 3: ""Public services play a crucial role in supporting and uplifting our communities. Let's keep advocating for strong and sustainable public services for all. #community #publicservices""

Of the three posts, Post 2 uses an Enhance tactic by providing additional information about the variety of services covered by public services and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing funding for them. This tactic encourages the topic-group to continue discussing and advocating for public services by highlighting the breadth of services that fall under this category.","1. ""Public services are essential for our communities to thrive. We must continue to invest in infrastructure and resources to ensure everyone has access to quality services.""

2. ""Our public services are underfunded and understaffed. It's time for our government to prioritize the needs of the people and allocate more resources to improve these critical services.""

3. ""Public services play a crucial role in promoting equality and social justice. We must work together to protect and strengthen these services for the benefit of all society.""

The Distort tactic is not used in any of these posts. All three posts emphasize the importance of public services, calling for investment, prioritization, and protection of these essential services.","1. ""Our public services are underfunded and overstretched. It's time for our government to prioritize the needs of the people over their own agendas. #publicservices #priorities""

2. ""I had to wait hours at the public health clinic just to see a doctor for five minutes. This is unacceptable - our healthcare system needs serious reform. #publicservices #healthcare""

4. ""As a teacher, I see firsthand how budget cuts are affecting our public education system. Our students deserve better than overcrowded classrooms and outdated resources. #publicservices #education"" 

Posts 2 and 3 use a Dismay tactic as they elicit negative emotions by highlighting the frustration and inadequacies of public services. The posts emphasize the negative experiences of individuals and suggest a need for change or improvement in public services.","Post 1: ""I can't believe how expensive my water bill is this month! The government really needs to do something about the rising cost of utilities. #publicservices #budgetwoes""

Post 2: ""Just visited my local library and I'm amazed at all the resources available to the community. Thank you to the hardworking librarians who make it all possible! #publicservices #communitysupport""

Post 3: ""Did you know that the average wait time at the DMV is over an hour? It's ridiculous how inefficient our public services are. #publicservices #improvementneeded""

Post 4: ""I think we should focus on improving public transportation in our city. It would make a huge difference in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. #publicservices #urbanplanning""

Post 5: ""Why do we even pay taxes if our public services continue to be inadequate? It's time for our government to step up and address these issues. #publicservices #taxpayerconcerns""

Post 1 uses a Distract tactic by bringing up the topic of water bills, which is a completely different and irrelevant topic to public services. This tactic serves to divert attention away from the main discussion and focus on an unrelated issue.

Post 5 also uses a Distract tactic by focusing on tax concerns, which shifts the conversation away from discussing public services directly.

Indonesia,Indonesia,The type of political goal for the posts is likely sabotage or disruption.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is likely to spread misinformation, cause confusion, and potentially disrupt social media platforms.",This is a spam operation sharing explicit content disguised as public service announcements on social media.,The starting month of the information operation for the posts is: October.,"The major themes from these posts include discussions about ""memekperawan"" (virgin pussy), ""memektembem"" (chubby pussy), ""memekbasah"" (wet pussy), ""openvcs"" (open video call sex), ""vcsreal"" (real video call sex), ""abgbugil"" (naked teenagers), ""sange"" (horny), ""abgsange"" (horny teenagers), ""abgcolmek"" (teenagers masturbating), ""bahancoli"" (masturbation material), ""ngewe"" (sexual intercourse), ""ngentod"" (sexual intercourse), ""ngentot"" (fucking), and ""SANGE_AAAAAAAAAH.""","Here are some of the fallacies present in the tweets:

There is also mention of international treaties and agreements, as well as potential military actions. Additionally, there is criticism of political parties and their handling of various issues.","1. Abusive Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the first post that directly attacks YvetteDAth by calling her a ""dud"" and accusing her of corruption without providing any evidence related to the discussion on public services.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the second post where the author uses emotionally charged language to criticize AnnastaciaMP and question her competence in handling public services without providing any logical reasoning.

3. Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the third post attacking AlboMP without any substantial evidence related to public services.

4. Ad Ignorantiam: This fallacy is present in the tweet questioning AlboMP's efforts in signing pointless treaties without providing any evidence or logical reasoning.

5. False Analogy: This fallacy is present in the tweet comparing Brisbane to a union worksite and making a faulty analogy between people dying at a worksite and the crisis in public services without any logical connection.

6. Red Herring: This fallacy is present in the tweet attacking YvetteDAth again without addressing any specific issues related to public services.

Goal: Undermining trust in government-run public services and advocating for decentralization.

- Biased Generalizing: This fallacy exists because the statement makes a sweeping generalization about all politicians without providing any evidence or reasoning to support it.

2. ""If you don't support funding for public services, you must not care about the well-being of the community.""

- Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists because the statement attacks the character or motives of those who don't support funding for public services, rather than addressing their arguments or reasons for their position.

Example post: ""Anyone who doesn't want to fund public services doesn't care about our community's well-being.""

3. ""Everyone knows that public services are a waste of taxpayer money.""

5. ""Experts agree that cutting funding for public services will have disastrous consequences for our community.""

2. ""I don't see the point in funding public services when they always seem to be inefficient and corrupt.""

Appeal to Authority fallacy: In the tweets calling out international actors to take action against dictator Aliyev, such as @EmmanuelMacron, @POTUS, @vonderleyen, @SecBlinken, @UN, @JosepBorrell, there is an appeal to authority, assuming that these figures have the power to take action on the matter.
Example post: ""When @SecBlinken call Dictator Aliyev to beg for peace, the #Dictator understands perfectly this is not serious As long as there is No Sanction, criminals states have green light Neutrality provides #Impunity #SanctionAliyev #StopArtakhBlockade""

2. Ad Hominem fallacy: Several tweets attack Aliyev personally, using insults and derogatory language rather than focusing on the actual issue at hand.
Example post: ""@FizuliJ @steve_hanke F u c k off .. #Artsakh is not #Azerbaijan .. Disputed #territory that needs international recognition of being called REPUBLIC OF ARTSAKH""

3. Circular Reasoning fallacy: In some tweets, the conclusion is being used as one of the premises, creating a circular argument.
Example post: ""Sanctions against dictator Aliyev if you don't want a new war! #SanctionAliyev #StopArtsakhBlockade""

4. False Cause fallacy: Some tweets imply that taking actions against Aliyev is the solution to certain issues without providing concrete evidence of the causation between the action and the outcome.
Example post: ""Sanctions against dictator Aliyev if you don't want a new war! #SanctionAliyev #StopArtsakhBlockade""

Please note that these fallacies are identified based on the text provided and the context in which they are presented.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts suggest an Armenian perspective on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Artsakh (also known as Nagorno-Karabakh). The following elements indicate this cultural context:

1. References to Artsakh, which is the Armenian name for the region in question.
2. The use of hashtags like #ArtsakhBlockade, #Artsakh, and #StopArtsakhBlockade, which are specific to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region.
3. Mention of the genocidal and despotic Aliyev regime, referring to the leadership of Azerbaijan.
4. Calls for sanctions against Aliyev and criticism of his actions towards Armenians in Artsakh.

6. The use of Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev as a target for criticism.
7. Reference to the @CIJ_ICJ legally binding decision related to the conflict.
8. References to international actors like the UN, EU Council, and various government officials urging them to take action against the Aliyev regime.
9. Claims of green light for criminals states and calls for international recognition of Artsakh as a separate entity.
10. References to Azerbaijan as a dictatorship and accusations of energy laundering to benefit the leadership.
11. Calls for recognition of Artsakh as an independent entity and the need for UN peacekeepers in the region.

5. Joining campaigns and signing petitions for global treaties and agreements to protect the environment.","Appeal to Emotions Fallacy:
The first set of posts use emotional language and imagery to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience. By emphasizing the negative impact of plastic pollution and urging people to demand support for a Global Plastics Treaty, they are appealing to the audience's emotions rather than providing logical arguments or evidence.

Example post: ""You can clean a beach ‚Äì but the plastic always comes back. Securing a Global #PlasticsTreaty at the UN can help us stop #PlasticPollution once and for all üôÖ World leaders meet this fall. Demand they support a ‚ú®strong‚ú® treaty! @GreenpeaceCa #Plastic""

Appeal to Authority Fallacy:
The second set of posts appeal to authority by referencing the UN and the Global Oceans Treaty as solutions to the problem of plastic pollution. By using the UN and global treaties as authorities on the topic, they imply that these organizations have the expertise and credibility to solve the issue.

Example post: ""Later this year, the UN is set to discuss a Global Oceans Treaty, which could help ensure 30% of our oceans are protected from destruction by 2030. Join the campaign here: https://t.co/YizRe7KaJG ü•≤üëèü¶àüíïüåä #Breaking""

Bandwagon Fallacy:
The third set of posts use the bandwagon fallacy by implying that everyone is supporting or joining the campaign for a Global Plastic Treaty. By encouraging others to join and be part of the movement, they create a sense of belonging and peer pressure to conform to the popular opinion.

Example post: ""I've signed on to join the call for a Global Plastic Treaty, will you join me? https://t.co/sWscUxl9XV #plasticstreaty via @greenpeacenz""

- The need for public services to be well-funded and efficiently managed
- The role of public services in promoting social equality and addressing societal needs
- Advocacy for investment in public services to improve infrastructure and support communities","1. Tweet: ""All politicians are corrupt, so we shouldn't invest in public services.""

Fallacy: Sweeping Generalization 

Explanation: This tweet makes a sweeping generalization by assuming that all politicians are corrupt, therefore concluding that investing in public services is not a good idea. 

Example: ""All cats are lazy, so we shouldn't adopt any pets.""

2. Tweet: ""If we don't increase taxes, public services will suffer and our community will be at risk.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Consequence

Explanation: This tweet uses fear mongering by appealing to the negative consequence of not increasing taxes, without providing evidence to support the claim.

Example: ""If you don't study for the exam, you will fail and ruin your future.""

3. Tweet: ""Public services should be funded by private companies to ensure better efficiency and quality.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Authority

Explanation: This tweet relies on the authority of private companies to suggest that they would be more efficient and provide better quality public services, without providing any evidence to support this claim.

Example: ""The CEO of the company said this product is the best on the market, so it must be true.""

4. Tweet: ""Everyone knows that government-run public services are always cheaper and better than privatized ones.""

Fallacy: Appeal to the Masses

Explanation: This tweet appeals to the majority opinion that government-run public services are better, without providing any actual evidence or reasoning to support the claim.

Example: ""Everyone is going to the new restaurant in town, so it must be good.""","1. ""New bill proposing increased funding for public services is a game-changer! üôå #SupportOurServices""

Let's all support and appreciate the hard work of those who keep our communities running smoothly.""

3. ""We should all take a moment to thank our public service workers for their dedication and hard work. They truly make a difference in our daily lives.""

Out of the three tweets, tweet #2 uses an Excite tactic by elicitng a positive emotion through the personal experience of receiving excellent public service. The tweet conveys joy and excitement by highlighting the efficiency and friendliness of the public service.","Post 1: ""Public services are essential for the well-being of our communities.

Post 3: ""The quality of our public services directly impacts our quality of life. Let's advocate for policies that support and improve these crucial services.""

In this set of posts, Post 2 uses an Enhance tactic by encouraging individuals to share their positive experiences with public services in order to highlight their importance and promote discussion on the topic. This helps to keep the conversation going and increase engagement on the issue of public services.","1. ""Public services are vital for a functioning society. They provide essential resources like healthcare, education, and transportation to all citizens. Let's support and invest in these crucial services for the betterment of our communities.""

3. ""The underfunding of public services is a disgrace. Families are struggling, and vulnerable populations are at risk. We must do better as a society."" 

In this context, post 2 and post 3 use a Dismay tactic by highlighting the negative impact of the lack of investment in public services on communities and vulnerable populations. These posts aim to elicit feelings of sadness, disappointment, and possibly anger in the audience.","Example of posts using a Distract tactic:

Post 2: ""I can't believe how rainy it's been lately! I hope it clears up for the weekend.""

Post 3: ""Have you seen the latest episode of that new TV show? It's so addicting!""

These posts use the Distract tactic because they are discussing completely irrelevant topics (coffee shops, weather, TV shows) instead of focusing on the discussion about public services.

   Fallacy: False Dichotomy
   Explanation: This post presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that the only two options are to have public services funded by taxpayer money or to privatize everything. There are other potential solutions that could involve a mix of public and private resources.
   Example: ""Either we fund public services with taxpayer money or let everything be privatized. There is no other option.""

2. ""Everyone knows that public services are inefficient and always have long wait times. We should just get rid of them altogether.""

   Explanation: This post relies on the popularity of the belief that public services are inefficient without providing evidence to support this claim. It assumes that just because many people believe something, it must be true.
   Example: ""The majority of people believe public services are inefficient, so we should eliminate them.""

3. ""I don't see why we need public services when we can just rely on the goodwill of businesses and individuals to provide for the community.""

   Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
   Explanation: This post makes a hasty generalization by assuming that public services only benefit certain groups of people without considering the overall impact they have on society. It also fails to provide evidence to support the claim that they are a burden on the economy.
   Example: ""Public services mainly benefit the wealthy and are dragging down our economy. We need to cut funding for them immediately.""","1. ""Just had the best experience at the DMV, got in and out in less than 10 minutes! #winning #efficientgovernment""

- The use of the term ""local library"" and the hashtag ""#supportpublicservices"" suggest a culture or in-group of individuals who value and actively support public services, specifically libraries as a resource for books and movies.

5. ""Without public services, many vulnerable populations would be left without crucial support. Let's advocate for inclusive and equitable access to these resources."" 

Out of these posts, post #3 uses an Explain tactic by elaborating on the specific types of public services that are considered essential rights for all individuals. This tweet provides details on the different areas such as healthcare, education, and transportation that fall under the umbrella of public services and emphasizes the importance of ensuring access to these resources for everyone.","1.

3. ""Just received excellent care at our local public health clinic. Grateful for the amazing work our public services provide. #thankful""

Posts 1 and 2 use an Excite tactic by expressing positive emotions such as joy and excitement about their experiences with public services. Post 3, while positive, does not have the same level of excitement as posts 1 and 2.","1. ""Public services are crucial for supporting our communities and providing equal access to essential resources.

Post 2: ""The government is wasting taxpayer money on bloated public services that are inefficient and poorly managed. It's time to privatize these services to save costs and improve quality for all citizens.""

Post 3: ""Without public services, many vulnerable populations would be left without essential resources and support. It's crucial that we prioritize funding and strengthening our public services to ensure that everyone has access to the help they need."" 

In this case, Post 2 is using a Distort tactic by painting public services as a wasteful and inefficient use of taxpayer money, which distorts the main message of the topic, which is the importance and value of public services in providing essential resources and support to all citizens.","1. ""Public services are essential for our communities to thrive and succeed. Let's continue to support and invest in them #publicservicesmatter #communityfirst""

4. ""The lack of investment in public services is not only hurting individuals in need, but also weakening the fabric of our society. We need to prioritize their importance #investinpublicservices"" 

Post #3 uses a Dismay tactic by highlighting the negative impact of public services being cut or underfunded, eliciting feelings of sadness or anger.","Post 1: ""I love how efficient and reliable our public transportation system is. It really makes getting around the city so much easier.""

Post 2: ""I think we should invest more in mental health services for the homeless population. It's important to address their needs and provide support.""

Post 4: ""Public libraries are such a valuable resource for our communities. I'm always amazed by the wide range of books and services they offer.""

Aditya Bhan's post about India being the third-highest military spender after the US and China can be categorized as Appeal to Force fallacy. This is because the argument is based on the notion that India is left with stark options due to the lead of the US and China, which is used to force the audience to accept the claim without providing valid evidence or reasoning. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""India is left with stark options.""

2. @viveksans' post regarding the US decoupling from China can be seen as a Red Herring fallacy. This is because the focus of the argument shifts from the main topic of public services to the reasons behind the US decoupling from China. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""to slow China‚Äôs technology-related advances.""

3. N Sathiya Moorthy's tweet discussing Saudi Arabia's funds can be considered as an Appeal to Authority fallacy. This is because the argument relies on the authority of Saudi Arabia to justify the partnership and investment, without providing substantial evidence or reasoning. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""Saudi Arabia‚Äôs funds fit Sri Lanka‚Äôs investment needs.""

4. @BartHoogeveen's tweet about developing nations in the Indo-Pacific region can be seen as an Appeal to Tradition Wisdom fallacy. This is because the argument relies on the belief or common practice that outside scrutiny is not needed for developing military cyber capabilities in the region. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""developing nations in #IndoPacific free reign to develop their military cyber capabilities without much outside scrutiny.""

5. Harsh V Pant & @AnantSMann's post discussing reducing American policy to the containment of China can be categorized as a Straw Man fallacy. This is because the argument misrepresents the actual position of the US in the region to make it easier to attack or criticize. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""To reduce American policy in the region to simply the containment of China.""

6. @bansh_jha's tweet questioning Prachanda's ability to address various issues can be seen as an Ad Hominem fallacy. This is because the argument attacks Prachanda's ability to address issues without directly addressing the concerns or issues themselves. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""Amidst political uncertainty, it is questionable if #Prachanda would succeed in addressing issues.""

7. @Kalpitm's tweet about Xi Jinping's stocktaking of China's armed forces can be categorized as Appeal to Consequence fallacy. This is because the argument implies that with China being at loggerheads with many neighbors over territorial disputes, there must be a specific outcome or consequence. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""stocktaking of China‚Äôs armed forces.""

8. @KartikBommakan1's post warning India to be cautious and shed complacency can be seen as an Appeal to Fear fallacy. This is because the argument uses fear or anxiety to persuade the audience to agree with the claim without providing appropriate evidence or reasoning. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""India will need to be cautious.""

9. @sushantsareen's tweet discussing India's action on the Indus Waters Treaty can be categorized as a Slippery Slope fallacy. This is because the argument suggests that India's action may lead to a series of events that will result in undesirable consequences without providing clear evidence or reasoning. An example of this fallacy in the post is: ""could India‚Äôs action on the Indus Waters Treaty become a license for it to build more structures on these rivers?""

10. Manoj Joshi's tweet about China claiming to have beaten COVID can be seen as an Appeal to Ignorance fallacy.
