The posts also mention the massive box office success of the movie, which could be seen as a prioritization of profit over other more important issues such as environmental concerns.","The cause of the problem that the following posts are mentioning explicitly or alluding to is the excessive focus on commercial promotion and profit generation related to the movie ""Pathaan,"" which is diverting attention and resources away from more important issues such as environmental concerns. The repeated urging of people to book tickets, celebrate the release, and highlight the box office success of the movie demonstrates a prioritization of financial gain over other social or global issues like environmental sustainability. This focus on profit and commercialization could be seen as contributing to a culture of consumerism and materialism that overlooks the urgent need to address and tackle environmental problems.","The remedy to the problem of excessive promotion and commercialization of the movie ""Pathaan"" is to shift the focus and resources towards more important issues such as environmental concerns. Instead of repeatedly urging people to book tickets and celebrate the box office success of the movie, efforts should be made to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainable practices. This could include using the platform and reach of the movie to spread messages about environmental conservation, reducing carbon footprint, and supporting eco-friendly initiatives. Additionally, the movie industry could consider investing a portion of its profits into environmental causes or initiatives to mitigate its impact on the environment. By redirecting attention and resources towards prioritizing environmental concerns, the excessive focus on profit and commercialization related to the movie ""Pathaan"" can be balanced with a more responsible and sustainable approach.","Metaphors related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets include:

1. ""The #Pathaan party is getting bigger"" - metaphorically suggesting that the promotion and commercialization of the movie ""Pathaan"" is gaining momentum and becoming more widespread, diverting attention from other important issues like environmental concerns.

2. ""History created with love from all over the world"" - metaphorically implying that the success and celebration of the movie ""Pathaan"" is overshadowing global environmental concerns, suggesting a need to redirect focus and resources towards more urgent issues.

3. ""A MUST-WATCH action spectacle"" - metaphorically emphasizing the excessive promotion and commercialization of the movie as a must-see entertainment event, highlighting the need to shift towards a more sustainable and responsible approach that considers environmental impacts.

4. ""PATHAAN 900 CRORES WORLDWIDE"" - metaphorically showcasing the massive financial success and box office numbers of the movie ""Pathaan,"" indicating a prioritization of profit over environmental sustainability and the need for a more balanced approach.

5. ""3...2...1...

Slogan: ""Book your tickets for #Pathaan now!""

Cause: Diverting attention and resources from environmental concerns
Slogan: ""Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you on 25th January""

Remedy: Shift focus towards environmental concerns
Slogan: ""Raise awareness about environmental conservation""

These slogans highlight the focus on promoting the movie ""Pathaan"" and urge people to book tickets, celebrate its release, and acknowledge its box office success. The remedy suggests redirecting attention and resources towards environmental concerns and promoting sustainable practices instead.","Text motifs explicitly mentioned related to the environmental concerns are:
- ""A MUST-WATCH action spectacle.""
- ""A high-octane blockbuster that CANNOT be missed!""
- ""An action spectacle to be gloriously remembered!""

China,China,None. Nature of the posts is personal admiration and support for the mentioned individuals.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is likely to distract and mislead from important environmental issues by flooding the feeds with unrelated content about celebrities and personal matters.,The information operation is likely focused on promoting positive messages and support for individuals named Huang Xuxi/Lucas Wong and their family members in order to distract from real environmental issues.,April,"1.

10. Advocacy for positive change and justice","The following intentional fallacies can be found in the provided tweets:

1. Appeal to Emotions - This fallacy can be seen in the Tweet by @XUXIUPDATES expressing love and support for Huang Xuxi. The emotional appeal to love and support can distract from the actual issue being discussed.

Example Post: ""We Lumis are always there for you Xuxi, And will always be! We love you Huang Xuxiüíóü¶Å""

2. Appeal to Authority - This fallacy can be found in the Tweet by @stephaniezen, where they mention the names of Olympic Gold Medallists in relation to the topic.

Example Post: ""The Mix Doubles Olympic Gold Medallists: Huang Dong Ping and Liliyana Natsir üî•ü•á""

3. Ad Hominem - This fallacy can be seen in various tweets where individuals are targeted based on their actions or behavior rather than focusing on the environmental issue.

Example Post: ""One of our Acters Lucas Wong Yukhei Huang Xuxi is moving his account to @Huangxuzxi due to dikutuk karena jadi Lim Asep. Please remember him, everyone!""

4. Appeal to the People - This fallacy is present in tweets that appeal to the audiences' feelings towards the individuals being discussed, rather than the environmental issues.

Example Post: ""manifesting we get Dylan Wang and Huang Xuxi in a drama/movie someday üôèüèæ""

Overall, these fallacies exist in the provided posts as they divert attention from the main topic of environmental issues and focus more on personal relationships and emotional appeals.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts imply a fan culture surrounding the Chinese pop group WayV, and specifically members Renjun, Lucas Wong (Huang Xuxi), and Huang Family.

Indonesia,Indonesia,Spread disinformation and distract from real political issues.,The political goal is to spread spam and potentially harmful content to generate traffic.,The information operation is promoting inappropriate content under the guise of sharing information on environmental issues.,The starting month is not clear as the tweets are unrelated to environmental issues.,"The major themes of the tweets are:
1. Sharing links to full duration videos related to a specific topic.
2. Encouraging viewers to join VIP groups for more information.
3. Hashtags related to sexual content, suggesting inappropriate or explicit material.
4. Asking viewers to engage in certain activities or watch certain videos.
5. Use of explicit language and content.","The fallacies found in the provided posts are Appeal to Emotions, Appeal to Popularity, Appeal to Tradition, Hasty Generalization, and Red Herring.

1. Appeal to Emotions: Posts like ""sange #sange_aaaaaaaaaah #bahancoli"" are intended to evoke strong emotions in the audience, which distracts them from the actual topic at hand, which is environmental issues.

2. Appeal to Popularity: The excessive use of hashtags such as ""memekperawan #abgbugil #ngentod"" is an attempt to align the posts with popular trends to gain attention, rather than focusing on the issue of environmental problems.

3. Appeal to Tradition: The posts consistently refer to joining a VIP group and using specific terms like ""#vcsreal."" This is an appeal to tradition, suggesting that following these norms or joining these groups is necessary, which again distracts from discussing environmental concerns.

4. Hasty Generalization: The posts consistently use similar language and hashtags in an attempt to reach a large audience quickly. However, this generalization does not address the nuances and complexities of environmental issues.

5. Red Herring: The main content of the posts, which seems to be about joining video groups, is misleading and irrelevant to the discussion of environmental issues. This is a classic example of a red herring fallacy, where the focus is shifted away from the main topic.

The main topics discussed in these posts are the threat of collaboration between China and Russia in military activities, technology theft, corruption, collusion between the Department of Justice and the Chinese Communist Party, and concerns about the weaponization of neuroscience and cyber operations. The remedy to these problems would involve addressing and mitigating the issues of corruption, collusion, and potential threats to Sino-U.S. relations, as well as finding solutions to prevent the weaponization of technology and cyber operations. Environmental issues are not the main focus of these tweets.","The post that uses a Dismiss tactic is:

""Most Of Communist China's Military Technology Is Due To IP Theft."" This post dismisses the importance of the Chinese military technology by attributing it to intellectual property theft, implying that the technology is not innovative or legitimate."
Argentina.,Argentina.,Celebrity endorsement of a political candidate.,There is no mention of environmental issues in the provided posts.,This is a coordinated campaign to promote Marcos Ginocchio as the winner of a reality show.,There is no specific month for the information operation.,"The major themes in these tweets are:

1. Discussion of reality show ""Gran Hermano"" and specifically contestant Marcos
2. Support and admiration for Marcos as a contestant on the show
3. Mention of other contestants on ""Gran Hermano"" such as Mora, Sol Perez, and Julieta
4. Celebration of Marcos Ginocchio winning Big Brother 2023
5. Use of hashtags related to the show, such as #GranHermano and #GH2022
6. Mention of voting for Marcos (MAROS AL 9009)
7. Use of emojis to express emotions and reactions to the show and its contestants.","1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy is present in the tweets that continuously mention Marcos and his popularity in Gran Hermano. The mere fact that Marcos is being talked about frequently and has a significant number of followers does not necessarily make him the right choice or the best candidate.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweets that express adoration or admiration for Marcos without providing any logical reasoning or evidence fall under this fallacy. Emotions are being used to manipulate the audience's opinion without any substantial argument.

3. Bandwagon: Some tweets encourage the audience to support Marcos because he is already popular or winning in the competition. This fallacy assumes that just because others are supporting him, the audience should do the same without considering any other factors.

4. Ad Hominem: There is a potential for this fallacy in some tweets that focus solely on Marcos without providing any substantial information or arguments related to the environmental issues topic. The focus on a specific individual instead of the actual topic at hand can distract from the main issue and lead to irrelevant discussions.

5. Straw Man: Tweets that set up Marcos as the central figure in the Gran Hermano environment without discussing his actual contributions to environmental issues can be considered a straw man fallacy. By focusing on a superficial aspect of the topic, the real discussion about environmental issues is sidelined. 

Example of appeal to popularity fallacy: 
""Marcos Ginocchio won Big Brother 2023 from start to finish. His consecration has never wavered. In the final, the 22-year-old from Salta won the 70.83% of votes among nearly eight million voters. As a boom.""

The culture implied by these posts is the fanbase or audience of the reality show ""Gran Hermano"" (Big Brother) in Argentina.

China,China,Promoting a cryptocurrency called #OGGYINU as a potential investment opportunity.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to promote and create hype around the cryptocurrency ""OGGYINU"" by suggesting that a bullrun will start from China and that investing in OGGYINU is the key to future financial security.","This appears to be a coordinated information operation promoting an altcoin called OGGYINU, linking it to CZ and a potential bullrun in China.",August,"The major themes from the tweets include:
1. Reference to cryptocurrency and potential bullrun starting in China
2. Promotion of buying and investing in a specific cryptocurrency called #OGGYINU to secure future gains
3. Use of hashtags related to cryptocurrency influencers and networks
4. Urgency and encouragement to take action and buy #OGGY before the bullrun starts
5. Mention of specific individuals, groups, and platforms in the cryptocurrency community
6. Repeated emphasis on the connection between the bullrun, China, and #OGGYINU
7. Calls to not be fooled and to secure future financial stability through investing in #OGGYINU.","The fallacies present in these posts are as follows:

- Bandwagon: This fallacy is present in many of the tweets because they are attempting to persuade people to buy into a certain cryptocurrency by suggesting that it is popular among others or that others are doing the same.

- Appeal to Authority: By referencing CZ (Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) in many of the tweets, the authors are appealing to his authority in the crypto world to lend credibility to their claims about the potential of the cryptocurrency they are promoting.

- Appeal to Emotions: The authors are using emotional language such as ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts"" to evoke fear of missing out or excitement about potential gains, rather than providing logical reasoning for why the cryptocurrency should be purchased.

- Appeal to Tradition: By repeatedly mentioning that the bullrun will start from China, the authors are appealing to the traditional notion that significant events in the crypto market often originate from China, without providing any evidence or logical explanation for this claim.

- Circular Reasoning: The tweets often repeat the same claim without providing any new information or evidence to support it, creating a circular argument that relies on the initial assertion that the bullrun will start from China and that purchasing the mentioned cryptocurrency is the way to secure future gains.

An example tweet for each fallacy:

- Bandwagon: ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""
- Appeal to Authority: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection?""
- Appeal to Emotions: ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""
- Appeal to Tradition: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection?""

The country targeted is Azerbaijan.,Azerbaijan,Subversion and destabilization of Azerbaijan,The political goal of the information operation is to pressure international actors to take action against the Aliyev regime for escalating agressions against Armenian people in Artsakh and Armenia.,"The operation is a coordinated effort to spread anti-Azerbaijan propaganda, calling for sanctions and intervention in the conflict with Armenia over Artsakh.",December,"1. #ArtsakhBlockade: The ongoing blockade of Artsakh by the Aliyev regime.
2. International Action: Calls for international actors to take action against the Aliyev regime and open the Lachin Corridor.
3. Democracy and Human Rights: Concerns about democracy, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes in Artsakh and Armenia.
4. Sanctions and Consequences: Calls for sanctions against Aliyev and consequences for violating international laws and agreements.
5. Racist and Genocidal Regime: Criticism of the Aliyev regime for racist and genocidal actions and propaganda against Armenians.
6. Western Inaction: Criticism of Western countries for not imposing sanctions on dictators like Aliyev and Erdogan, leading to continued military aggressions and war crimes.","The following fallacies can be identified in the provided posts:

1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present when the authors of the posts appeal to the authority of political figures like Emmanuel Macron, Joe Biden, and others to support their arguments for sanctioning Aliyev. The assumption here is that these authorities have the power and knowledge to make decisions about sanctioning, which may not necessarily be true.
Example post: ""@EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @JosepBorrellF @POTUS @SecBlinken aggressions from the Aliyev regime on Armenian people in Artsakh & Armenia keep escalating despite your calls and the @CIJ_ICJ decision. Democracy and ethnic cleaning are at stake #StopArtsakhBlockade #SanctionAliyev""

2. Appeal to Emotions: The posts appeal to emotions by using strong language like ""genocidal & despotic Aliyev regime,"" ""democracy and ethnic cleaning are at stake,"" and ""sanctions must be taken."" These emotionally charged phrases are used to evoke sympathy and support for their cause without providing strong logical arguments.
Example post: ""Sanctions must be taken. The EU gas deal must be canceled. International justice must sue him for his war crimes.""

3. Poisoning the Well: This fallacy is present when derogatory statements are made about Aliyev before presenting the arguments against his regime. By labeling him as genocidal, despotic, corrupt, and criminal, the authors attempt to discredit him before providing any evidence or reasoning against him.
Example post: ""Corrupt & criminal dictator @presidentaz been corrupting British politicians and companies for decades. This kind of racism, discrimination, & #xenophobia by @transglobalexpr is sickening to the core.""

4. Ad Hominem: There are instances of ad hominem attacks in the posts, such as calling someone ""Pinocchio Ismayilov"" or referring to Aliyev as ""not above international laws but he acts as if he was."" These attacks on the character or credibility of individuals distract from the main argument being made.
Example post: ""@IsmayilovFN @ICRC Yes ok Pinocchio Ismayilov, check your mirror. Your nose is getting longer than Aliyev‚Äôs""

These fallacies exist in the posts because they rely on emotional manipulation, appeals to authority, character attacks, and derogatory language rather than presenting logical and rational arguments based on evidence and sound reasoning.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate an Armenian cultural identity. The posts refer to the genocidal actions of the Aliyev regime against Armenian people in Artsakh and Armenia, calling for international actors like the UN and EU to take action, using hashtags like #StopArtsakhBlockade and #SanctionAliyev. References are made to specific political figures like Emmanuel Macron and Josep Borrell, as well as international legal bodies like the @CIJ_ICJ. Terms like ""Armenian diaspora"" and ""Artsakh blockade"" are also used, reflecting a specific cultural and geopolitical context related to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

These posts divert attention from important topics such as plastic pollution and environmental treaties."
China,China,Disinformation - Promoting cryptocurrency investment with false claims about China's involvement.,"The political goal of the information operation is to promote and pump the meme coin $pepa, focusing on a forthcoming ""bullrun"" that will supposedly start from China.",Environmental concerns are being manipulated to promote the cryptocurrency $pepa.,May,"Themes: 
1. Promotion of a specific meme coin ($pepa) as the best option to invest in for potential gains.
2. Reference to a potential bull run in the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on China and connections to $pepa coin.
3. Discussion of the importance of securing one's future by buying $pepa coin before the speculated bull run.
4. Promotion of a new project related to AI launching its first utility.
5. Mention of the role of influencers and Chinese marketing in the success of a project.
6. Links to specific cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms for buying or trading $pepa coin.","The fallacies that can be identified in these tweets include Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Popularity, Appeal to Consequence, Appeal to Tradition, Appeal to Vanity, Bandwagon, Circular Reasoning, Proof Surrogate, Question Begging, Reversing Causation, and Straw Man.

Example of each fallacy:
- Appeal to Authority: ""Tell me if you're bullish or bearish, cause peeps been hyped lately on all the memes and especially 'Pepe' and kept saying the ''Chinese'' are coming to pump their bags and the SEC lol. You buying, selling, or just FK IT ALL and sit laid back?""
- Appeal to Popularity: ""1b MC goal.""
- Appeal to Consequence: ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""
- Appeal to Tradition: ""Killed 1 zero.""
- Appeal to Vanity: ""Marketing social platform ‚úÖ AI bot.""
- Bandwagon: ""#pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection?""
- Circular Reasoning: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection?""
- Proof Surrogate: ""Tell me if you're bullish or bearish.""
- Question Begging: ""Do you got the connection?""
- Reversing Causation: ""Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""
- Straw Man: ""Tell me if you're bullish or bearish.""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts reveal a specific culture related to cryptocurrency trading and investment, particularly focusing on meme coins and potential bullruns. The use of hashtags like #CZ, references to China as a key player in the market, mentions of specific meme coins like #Pepe and $pepa, and references to influencers in the crypto space all point to a specific group of individuals interested in the cryptocurrency market.

The shared hashtag #CZ likely refers to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suggesting a connection to the Binance community. The emphasis on Chinese market movements and influencers like CZ indicates a focus on market trends and potential opportunities for investment. Additionally, the repeated mention of specific meme coins and the use of rocket ship and frog emojis imply a culture of excitement and speculation within this crypto community. 

Other cues, such as references to staking claims on a particular date and the use of terms like 'doxx KYC Audit' and 'massive influencers support + Chinese marketing,' suggest a language and culture related to the fast-paced, speculative world of cryptocurrency trading, where individuals are constantly seeking new opportunities and trends to capitalize on.","1.

Example post for Appeal to Popularity fallacy: ""National Signing Day is next Wednesday Feb 1st, Can't wait to announce our newest additions to the cardinal family.""

India,China,These posts are pushing an anti-China political goal.,The political goal of the information operation is anti-China sentiment and promoting alliances against China.,"Information Operation: Influence Operations and Propaganda 
Topic: Environmental Issues",January,"The major themes from the provided posts are primarily focused on geopolitical tensions between China, Russia, the US, and other countries in the context of military aggression and strategic interests. The posts also highlight concerns about military capabilities, cyber warfare, and regional security dynamics. There is a specific emphasis on China's actions and intentions, as well as its impact on neighboring countries like Taiwan and India. Additionally, there is a discussion about global alliances, military spending, and the need for strategic dialogue on regional security issues.","1. Appeal to Consequence: The tweet that mentions that China is using Russia's aggression against Ukraine to bolster an anti-Western narrative could be seen as appealing to the consequences of China's actions rather than addressing the main issue of Russia's aggression.
Example: ""#China has used #Russia‚Äôs aggression against #Ukraine to bolster an anti-Western narrative to suit its agenda, which comes in handy in connection with its aggressive designs on Ukraine.""

2. Appeal to Authority: The tweet that mentions a rare strategic dialogue between India and NATO could be seen as appealing to the authority of NATO in the context of regional security.
Example: ""New Delhi is set to host a rare strategic dialogue with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) focused on regional security issues.""

3. Bandwagon: The tweet that mentions the global focus on China and how it has led developing nations in the Indo-Pacific to develop their military cyber capabilities could be seen as appealing to the bandwagon effect of following what others are doing.
Example: ""Global focus on #China seems to have offered developing nations in #IndoPacific free reign to develop their military #cyber capabilities without much outside scrutiny.""

4. False Dilemma: The tweet that mentions that India is the third-highest military spender after the US and China could be seen as presenting a false dilemma by comparing India to these two countries without considering other factors.
Example: ""While #India has been the third-highest #military spender after US & #China since 2020, both those countries have such a lead over India in #defence spending & armed forces modernisation.""

5. Ad Hominem: The tweet that defends PM Modi's government against accusations of being far-right or authoritarian could be seen as using ad hominem attacks to dismiss the criticisms without addressing the actual concerns.
Example: ""The present Indian Govt, is the most effective secular/socialist govt in post independence India.
