3. Success and box office performance of movies like ""PS2,"" ""Adipurush,"" ""Luka Chuppi"", and ""MSDhoniTheUntoldStory""
4. Anticipation and excitement for upcoming movie releases
5. Requests to book tickets for various movies online.","1. Appeal to Emotions fallacy exists in the post by @prakashraaj where the emotional appeal is made to vote for an inclusive Karnataka and against communal politics and corruption. This is meant to sway individuals based on their emotions rather than logical reasoning.
Example: ""Vote for the party that cares about all Karnataka citizens, not just a select few. Do the right thing for your fellow citizens.""

2. Loaded Language fallacy exists in the post by @UV_Creations where the phrases like ""Humbled with your love"" and ""triumph"" are used to create a positive image of the movie and encourage ticket sales with emotionally charged language.
Example: ""Experience the awe-inspiring journey of Adipurush, a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless. Book your tickets now and be part of the magic.""

3. Appeal to Authority fallacy exists in the post by @TSeries where the success and high box office collections of the movie Adipurush are highlighted to appeal to the authority of the filmmakers and actors involved, suggesting that because the movie is successful, it must be a good movie.
Example: ""Adipurush, the movie that critics are raving about and audiences are flocking to see. Experience the magic for yourself - book your tickets now!""

4. Hasty Generalization fallacy exists in the tweet from @TutejaJoginder where a negative and generalized statement is made about the movie without providing any evidence or logical reasoning behind the claim.
Example: ""No one will watch. Faltu sala.""

5. Bandwagon fallacy exists in the tweet by @Manjina_Hani where the call for action to file a complaint against a certain individual is made based on the idea that others have done so in the past and it is the right thing to do.
Example: ""Let's show what happens when our patience run out of threshold! File a NSA against this man like DMK did.""

Each of these fallacies presents an illogical argument or manipulative tactic to persuade individuals to adopt a certain viewpoint or take a particular action without sound reasoning.","1.

United Kingdom,Russia,Discrediting political opponents.,Political goal: Create a negative perception of the Conservative Party regarding corruption and deceit to promote a General Election and prompt political change.,"Disinformation operation focusing on spreading negative sentiments about the Conservative Party and UK government, with a call for a general election.",January,"The major themes from the provided posts include corruption within the government, calls for a general election, dissatisfaction with the Tory party, accusations of dishonesty and deceit, and a desire for a change in leadership.","1. Poisoning the Well: This fallacy is present in the post accusing the government of being immoral and corrupt without providing any specific evidence or reasoning. It creates a negative bias against the government without addressing the actual issue or presenting valid arguments.

Example: ""Further evidence of how immoral and corrupt our government is. #ToryScum #ToriesOut301 #GeneralElectionNow Minister snubbed warning from elections watchdog over foreign donations""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet attacking the Conservative Party without addressing any specific policies or actions.

Example: ""Has the Conservative Party become the most corrupt and despised political party in Britain history?""

3. Hasty Generalization: This fallacy is present in the tweet making broad generalizations about the Conservative Party without providing specific examples or evidence to support the claim.

Example: ""Is watching the Tories implode actually a benefit of Brexit? Couldnt happen to a nastier, more self-centred, cruel, arrogant, incompetent, corrupt, deceitful bunch of rich bar stewards.""

4. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be seen in tweets using emotionally charged language and rhetoric to sway opinion instead of presenting logical arguments.

Example: ""FREEPORTS CORRUPTION NADHIM ZAHAWI wife Lana Saib Dec 2020, her company bought Chunnel Industrial Estate, a stone’s throw from the land to become the Sevington inland border facility in Ashford, Kent. Days before the EU-UK trade agreement was signed 😡""

5. Guilt by Association: This fallacy is present in the tweet linking individuals to corruption without providing sufficient evidence or justification for the claim.

South Korea,China,The type of political goal for these posts is likely to promote a positive image of a specific leader or group within the energy industry.,Promoting support for Lucas as a solo artist - unrelated to energy.,"Description: Coordinated effort to welcome Lucas back as a solo artist, rallying support from Lumis fans using specific hashtags and emojis. 

Theme: Energy",There is no information on energy in the provided posts.,"The major themes from the given posts are:
1. Welcome back to Lucas and showing support for him.
2. Referring to Lucas as a solo artist.

4. Using the hashtag #SoloistLucas to show support.
5. Reiterating the support from the Lumis fanbase.
6. Indicating that Lucas will always be supported as a member of Lumis.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The fallacy of appeal to emotions occurs when the speaker or writer attempts to persuade based on an emotional response rather than on appropriate evidence or reasons.

Example: ""WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""

2. Bandwagon: The bandwagon fallacy occurs when one argues that something must be right because everyone believes it or is doing it. In this case, multiple users are expressing support for Lucas, which could influence others to do the same without critically evaluating the situation.
Example: ""RT @LUMISUNION Lucas is going to be active as a solo artist from now on. WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when one assumes that something is better or correct simply because it's been done that way for a long time. In this case, the users are welcoming back Lucas and declaring their support because it is a tradition among fans to show support for their favorite artists.
Example: ""RT @jimind0pe__ @luchearst WELCOME BACK LUCAS 🦁 Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei 💛 #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #黄旭熙""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts point to a fanbase or fan community dedicated to supporting Lucas, also known as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei, who is a solo artist.

Solution:
The solution to the problem mentioned in these tweets is to report and block the accounts that are promoting inappropriate or sexually explicit content. Users should refrain from clicking on any links shared in these tweets to prevent further dissemination of such content and to keep the discussion on the topic of energy.

Remedy:
It is important to report and block the accounts promoting inappropriate content and to avoid engaging with or encouraging the sharing of inappropriate material. By taking these actions, the discussion on the topic of energy can be maintained without being derailed by unrelated and explicit content.",

RT @AllBiteNoBark88: Abusive Ad Hominem - This fallacy exists in this post because instead of addressing the issue at hand, the user attacks the Bidens as corrupt without providing evidence. 
Example: Tweet insinuating the Bidens are corrupt without evidence.
2. RT @SallyPresto: Appeal to Money - This fallacy exists in this post because the user is highlighting the financial ties between WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to suggest bias.
Example: Tweet questioning if nations should be controlled by the WHO Treaty due to its funding sources.
3. RT @SuperHotPeppers: Abusive Ad Hominem - This fallacy exists in this post because the user attacks Bruce Pascoe's credibility by calling him an ""Expert Conman"" without engaging with his arguments.
Example: Tweet questioning Bruce Pascoe's expertise.
4. RT @SeekerTheGreat1: False Dichotomy - This fallacy exists in this post because the user presents a binary choice of ""communist rubbish"" or being a part of the Liberal Party without considering other possibilities or nuances.
Example: Tweet suggesting that any Liberal MP supporting certain policies should not be in the party.
5. RT @RebelNews_AU: Appeal to Authority - This fallacy exists in this post because the user highlights Bill Gates' association with the Chinese Communist Party to suggest a negative implication.
Example: Tweet linking Bill Gates' meetings with Chinese officials to negative implications.
6. RT @PanData19: Appeal to Tradition - This fallacy exists in this post because the user encourages writing to representatives to voice objections to a proposed treaty as a way to resist change.
Example: Tweet encouraging writing to officials to oppose a WHO power grab.
7. RT @1Swinging_Voter: Straw Man - This fallacy exists in this post because the user misrepresents the opposition's position as being solely about the ""REAL plan"" without engaging with the complexities of the issue.
Example: Tweet suggesting that there is a hidden agenda behind a public plan.
8. RT @QBCCIntegrity: False Equivalence - This fallacy exists in this post because the user equates the concept of ""Voice, Treaty & Truth"" to Reparations (cash) without providing evidence of this connection.
Example: Tweet suggesting a link between the concepts Voice, Treaty, Truth and cash reparations.
9. RT @DuaneHope5: Appeal to Authority - This fallacy exists in this post because the user cites Robert Friedland to support claims about copper's prospects without providing additional evidence.

Some of the common themes include distrust of international organizations like the WHO, suspicion of Chinese influence, opposition to treaties and reparations for indigenous peoples, and concern about corruption and authoritarianism in government. The language used in these posts suggests a sense of persecution, fear of loss of control, and a desire for independence and sovereignty. The posts also express support for figures like Donald Trump and opposition to figures like Bill Gates, signaling alignment with a particular political ideology.

United Kingdom,Malaysia,Spreading misinformation about energy.,"There is no clear political goal in these tweets, as they are promoting a live stream of a boxing match, not related to energy.",Spam operation promoting live streams of KSI vs Joe Fournier fight.,November,"The major themes from the tweets provided are focused on live streaming links for various events related to energy. The hashtags #KSIFournier, #KSI, #Misfits007, #DejiSwarmz, and #Deji are also recurring in the posts.
","1. Appeal to Popularity (Ad Populum): This fallacy is present in all the posts because they are promoting live streams of popular events such as KSI vs Joe Fournier. The implicit argument is that since these events are popular, you should watch the live streams.

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy is present in all the posts because they are encouraging people to join the live streams of the events, implying that everyone else is doing it. The idea is to make people feel like they should also be part of the crowd.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the posts as they use emotional language and symbols (emojis) to incite excitement and engagement in the live streams. The posts are designed to evoke an emotional reaction from the audience.

2. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in tweets that rely on the credibility of individuals or organizations without providing solid evidence. For example: ""The man who insisted on a public inquiry to lay bare the facts of this dubious story simply didn’t want to know them himself.""

3. False Equivalence: This fallacy is present in tweets that make unjustified comparisons between different individuals or situations. For example, comparing the CPC to groups bent on destroying the United States.

4. Straw Man: This fallacy is present in tweets that misrepresent or exaggerate the positions of others in order to make them easier to attack. For example: ""Erin O’Toole tries to exaggerate how CCP interference targeting him may have had an impact on his campaign.""

5. Slippery Slope: This fallacy is presented in tweets that suggest a series of increasingly dire consequences will result from one action. For example, suggesting that Pierre Poilievre is becoming a liability to conservatives.

4. Transfer of energy: Arkansas assistant coach accepting a new head coach position at CSUSB 
5. Injury recovery and return to play: updates on players expected to return with positive energy to the team and upcoming games","The fallacies present in the posts are as follows:

1. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy is present in the tweet ""The return of Devo Davis was a pleasant surprise for many Hog fans."" The argument is that fans are happy to see a player return based on past experiences, which is an appeal to tradition.

2. Appeal to Popular Belief: This fallacy is evident in the tweet ""Wegner, Josenberger still out, but Diamond Hogs expect them back by SEC Tournament."" The argument here is that the expectation for the players to return is based on the popularity or belief by the team, rather than concrete evidence.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be seen in the tweet ""Grant Nelson appreciation day. It's a great day to become a Hog!!!"" The argument appeals to the emotions of the readers by encouraging them to join the team based on emotional sentiment rather than logical reasoning.

4. False Dilemma: This fallacy can be found in the tweet ""The winner of that game takes on Arkansas on Thursday in the quarterfinals."" The statement creates a false dilemma by implying that there are only two possible outcomes - either winning the game and moving on to face Arkansas, or losing.

5. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in the tweet ""Arkansas in-state receiver target CJ Brown made his first of five official visits to Arkansas this weekend and the visit went 'smooth'."" The argument relies on the authority of the official visit to validate the success of the trip.

Example:

1. Appeal to Tradition: ""Fans are excited for the upcoming season because the team has always performed well in the past."" This statement assumes that the team's past success guarantees future success.

2. Appeal to Popular Belief: ""Everyone loves our new uniforms, so they must be the best in the league."" This statement assumes that popularity equates to quality.

3. Appeal to Emotions: ""Join our team and be a part of something special that will change your life forever."" This statement attempts to appeal to the reader's emotions to persuade them to join the team.

4. False Dilemma: ""You're either with us or against us."" This statement presents a false choice by suggesting there are only two options when there may be others.

5. Appeal to Authority: ""According to the coach, our team is the best in the division."" This statement relies on the authority of the coach to assert the team's superiority.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include:

4. Promotion of upcoming events such as cheer camp and matches

This usage of the term ""NPC"" is derogatory and dismissive of those who hold similar beliefs.

This post proposes that individuals who trigger others by expressing admiration, respect, and belief in the same things as a fictional character named Donkey Hodie should be congratulated for being labeled as ""NPCs."" This implies that triggering others with such behavior is a positive outcome and reinforces the use of the term ""NPC"" in a derogatory manner.

China.,China,Economic manipulation.,Promoting and pumping the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU before a bullrun starts.,"Cryptocurrency information operation promoting the purchase of #OGGYINU before a bullrun, using references to China and CZ.",April,"The major themes present in these posts are:
- Emphasis on the potential bullrun in the cryptocurrency market starting from China
- Promotion and recommendation of investing in #OGGYINU as a way to secure future gains before the bullrun starts
- Urging readers not to miss out on the opportunity to buy #OGGYINU before the bullrun begins
- Focus on the connection between the bullrun starting from China and the investment potential of #OGGYINU","One common fallacy that exists in these posts is the Appeal to Authority fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone asserts that a claim is true because an authority figure or expert says it is true. In this case, the posters are referencing CZ (#CZ) as the authority figure predicting that the bull run will start from China and promoting #OGGY as the cryptocurrency to invest in. 

Example post associated with Appeal to Authority fallacy: 
@CryptoThro As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts

Another fallacy present in these posts is the Bandwagon fallacy. This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because a large number of people believe something, it must be true. In this case, the posters are encouraging others to join them in investing in #OGGY because it is supposedly connected to the predicted bull run.

Example post associated with Bandwagon fallacy: 
@CryptoMiners_Co @RedbellyNetwork As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts

These fallacies exist in the posts because they are attempting to persuade others to invest in #OGGY by appealing to the authority of CZ and suggesting that since many others are investing, it must be a wise decision. These tactics are meant to manipulate emotions and create a sense of urgency or fear of missing out, rather than providing logical and evidence-based reasons for investing.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts are related to cryptocurrency and investing. The use of hashtags such as #CZ, #OGGYINU, and references to bull runs suggest that the culture or in-group is made up of individuals involved in the cryptocurrency market and interested in making investments in emerging digital assets.

The posts also mention China as a starting point for the bull run and emphasize the importance of buying and holding onto a specific cryptocurrency, #OGGY, to secure future financial success. This indicates that the culture or in-group is likely focused on speculation and trading within the cryptocurrency sector, with a particular focus on potential growth opportunities in the market.","- #CZ

The tweets also mention the involvement of other countries, such as Turkey, and the need for peace and a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan.","The fallacies present in the tweets are:

Example: Some “reliable partner” huh @vonderleyen. You must be so proud of the tin pot dictator Aliyev, who is simultaneously the lap dog of 2 dictators. Next time you talk about European values we will try not to laugh

The tweet mentions Dow Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling offering an explanation about the PLASTICS Industry's role at the UNEA Global Plastics Treaty Agreement. By mentioning a high-ranking official in the industry, the tweet tries to lend credibility to the argument.

Example: ""Dow Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling supports the Global Plastics Treaty Agreement, so it must be a good idea.""

False Cause: The tweet by @Rail_splitter1 seems to exhibit the False Cause fallacy. The tweet mentions Orbán winning elections through manipulation and shenanigans and then unrolling extra social spending. It implies that the social spending is a result of the manipulation.

Example: ""Orbán won because of manipulation, which led to social spending.""

Misleading Vividness: The tweet by @AlecLuhn could be seen as an example of Misleading Vividness. It highlights a military base burning near Moscow, which could evoke strong emotional responses from readers. However, it may not be a representative example of the broader topic of energy.

Example: ""Russian military base burning outside Moscow is a sign of escalating tensions.""

Brazil.,Brazil.,Influence operation - Promoting a specific candidate.,To manipulate the voting outcome of #SECAwards for #ArtistaAsiatico in favor of Marcos.,Coordinated inauthentic behavior promoting a specific artist for an award show.,February,"The major themes in the posts are:
1. Voting for #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the #SECAwards
2. Mentioning Marcos in conjunction with the vote for #RM
3. Including the year 2023 in relation to the #SECAwards
4. Using hashtags relating to the topic of the SEC Awards and energy","1. Bandwagon fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because a majority of people believe something or are doing something, it must be true or right. The posts with multiple accounts tagging each other and all voting for the same option can be seen as an example of the bandwagon fallacy.

2. Appeal to authority fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade an audience by appealing to an authority or celebrity, rather than providing actual evidence or reasoning. In this case, if any of these accounts claim to have authority on the subject or to represent a significant group of people, it could be seen as an appeal to authority fallacy.

3. Red herring fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone introduces irrelevant information to divert attention from the main argument or topic. The tweet ""I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the 2023 #SECAwards Marcos"" includes information about a future event (2023) which is unrelated to the current discussion about the award voting.

4. Ad hominem fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. None of the posts in this list contain direct personal attacks, but if any of the accounts were to question the integrity, credibility, or authority of another account without addressing the actual voting choice, it would be an example of an ad hominem fallacy.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts are related to the fandom of the K-pop group BTS, specifically fans of member RM (formerly known as Rap Monster). The hashtags #RM, #ArtistaAsiatico, and #SECAwards are all references to BTS and RM's music, as well as a specific award show. The usernames such as @knj_brasil and @demonarmys also indicate that these fans are part of the BTS fan community, with ""knj"" standing for Kim Namjoon (RM's real name) and ""demonarmys"" being a reference to RM's alter ego, RM the Monster. The use of the name Marcos in some of the tweets is likely a personal or fan nickname for RM. Overall, the culture and in-group implied by these posts is that of BTS fans, particularly those who support RM.","Language motifs mentioned in the posts include:
1. ""I vote""
2. ""#RM""

(Note: The tweets provided contain football player names, positions, high schools, and hashtags related to college recruitment.)",February,"The major themes from these posts include National Signing Day for college football recruits, welcoming new players to the team, promoting recruitment efforts with hashtags like #Swarm23ason and #EarnIT, and showcasing the different positions of the newly signed players (defensive end, quarterback, offensive lineman, tight end, linebacker, running back, athlete, wide receiver, defensive back, and defensive tackle).","An example of the fallacy ""Appeal to Emotions"" can be found in the first post that uses phrases such as ""Can't wait to announce our newest additions"" and ""Swarm23ason"" to evoke excitement and enthusiasm for National Signing Day. This fallacy seeks to manipulate the emotions of the audience rather than providing logical reasoning.

An example of the fallacy ""Appeal to Authority"" can be seen in the second post where the defensive end Allon Hill is welcomed with the statement ""Signed Welcome, Allon Hill!"" The use of exclamation points and capitalization of the player's name gives undue authority to the announcement.

An example of the fallacy ""Ad Populum"" can be observed in the third post where the Quarterback Nick Patterson is welcomed with ""Signed Welcome, Nick Patterson!"" The post is appealing to the popularity of the player and the excitement surrounding his signing to garner attention.

Overall, these posts contain various intentional fallacies such as Appeal to Emotions, Appeal to Authority, and Appeal to Popularity, to create hype and excitement around the National Signing Day event.","Cultural cues and in-group language used in the posts:

Philippines,India,Geostrategic positioning in the Indo-Pacific.,Political goal: Highlighting regional tensions and power dynamics surrounding China in the Indo-Pacific region.,Description: Coordinated information operation promoting specific narratives about security issues and geopolitical tensions related to China in the Asia-Pacific region.,August,"The major themes in these tweets include:
1. Military tensions and activities in the South China Sea involving countries such as South Korea, China, Russia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
2. Strategic partnerships and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly related to military exercises and deployments.
3. Geopolitical dynamics and power competitions between countries like the US, China, and India.
4. The importance of balancing national interests with a common approach towards China, especially within the EU.
5. Implications of China's foreign relations, particularly in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.
6. Tensions and negotiations involving claimant countries and China in the South China Sea.
7. The weaponization of technology and its impact on democracies in the Indo-Pacific region.
8. India's role in bridging democratic camps and balancing relations with China and the Global South.","1. Red Herring: This fallacy occurs when an irrelevant topic is introduced to divert attention from the original issue. In this case, the tweet about detecting Chinese and Russian military aircraft does not directly relate to the topic of energy.
Example: RT @sentdefender The Republic of Korea Air Force (South Korea) has announced that earlier this morning it had Detected and Tracked at least 4 Chinese and 4 Russian Military Aircraft that had entered the Korean Air-Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) over the Sea of Japan and the South China Sea… https://t.co/4GqKT6TCfM

2. False Dichotomy: This fallacy occurs when only two options are presented when more exist. In this case, the tweet suggests that the only options for the Philippines are to align with the US or with China, ignoring other potential alliances or strategies.
Example: The #Philippines continues to be embroiled in overarching regional dynamics of Southeast Asia influenced by intensifying power competition between its traditional ally, the US & its largest immediate neighbour, #China: @DonMcLainGill95 https://t.co/Nqz6jjt99g

3. Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when an argument is directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining. In this tweet, there is a personal attack on a commentator rather than addressing the issue at hand.
Example: RT @KanwalSibal Nonsense. Human rights harpy wading ignorantly into geopolitics. US remains neutral on India/Pak territorial issues. India-China issues r decades old. US has been neutral/also built massive ties with China. We know “everyone else” is& will be neutral on India-China land issues.","- The Republic of Korea Air Force
