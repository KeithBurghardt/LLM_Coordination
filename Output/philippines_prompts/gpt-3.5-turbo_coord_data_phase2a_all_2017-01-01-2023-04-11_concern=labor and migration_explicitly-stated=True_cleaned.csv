- Highlighting the love and dedication towards movie-making
- Showing the impact and excitement surrounding the movie's release, including houseful shows
- Engaging with fans and encouraging them to be part of the celebration by watching the movie at cinemas
- Featuring various promotions, reviews, and reactions related to the movie ""Pathaan""","1. Appeal to Popularity - The tweets are constantly promoting the movie ""Pathaan"" and claiming it to be a blockbuster and a must-watch. This fallacy is used to appeal to the popularity of the movie and encourage people to watch it based on its supposed success.
Example post: ""Witness the rollercoaster ride of action and entertainment as it roars across theatres! #Pathaan Book your tickets - [Link provided]""

2. Appeal to Emotions - The tweets use emotional language to create excitement and urgency around booking tickets for the movie. This appeal is made to evoke emotions in the audience rather than providing logical reasons to watch the film.
Example post: ""SRKians from #Purna #Maharashtra celebrating #PathaanDay 💥 Book your tickets now: [Link provided]""

3. Bandwagon - The tweets mention the large number of people watching and enjoying the movie, creating a bandwagon effect where people are encouraged to join the crowd and watch the movie to be part of the trend.

4. Loaded Language - The tweets use positive and hyperbolic language to describe the movie, such as ""BLOCKBUSTER,"" ""UNSTOPPABLE,"" and ""world is full of never-seen-before action."" This loaded language is meant to persuade the audience of the movie's quality without providing concrete evidence.
Example post: ""#Pathaan's world is full of never-seen-before action! Come watch this incredible behind-the-scenes journey HERE! Book your tickets now - [Link provided]""

The emphasis on booking tickets, celebrating box office success, and the extravagant promotion of the movie ""Pathaan"" by production companies and fan clubs suggest a culture of exploiting labor (actors, crew, etc.) for profit and glamorizing migration to big cities like Mumbai for work in the film industry.","The cause of the problem alluded to in these tweets is the glamorization and promotion of big budget films like ""Pathaan"" by production companies and fan clubs, which creates a culture that exploits labor in the film industry. This exploitation can involve long hours, low pay, and unstable working conditions for actors, crew, and other workers involved in the production. Additionally, the migration of individuals to big cities like Mumbai in hopes of finding work in the film industry further exacerbates the issue of labor exploitation. The emphasis on booking tickets, celebrating box office success, and promoting the movie as a blockbuster success perpetuates this cycle of exploitation for profit and entertainment.","The remedy to the problem of labor exploitation and migration alluded to in these tweets is to prioritize and advocate for fair labor practices and conditions within the film industry. This includes advocating for decent wages, reasonable working hours, and safe working conditions for all individuals involved in the production of films such as ""Pathaan."" Instead of solely focusing on booking tickets, celebrating box office success, and promoting the movie through extravagant means, there should be a shift towards valuing and respecting the labor of actors, crew, and other workers. This can be achieved by supporting initiatives that promote fair treatment of workers, advocating for policies that protect workers' rights, and raising awareness about the importance of ethical labor practices within the film industry. Additionally, there should be efforts to address the underlying issues that drive individuals to migrate to big cities like Mumbai for work in the film industry, such as lack of opportunities and economic disparity in their home regions. By addressing these issues, the film industry can create a more equitable and sustainable working environment for all individuals involved.","Metaphors explicitly mentioned related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets:

1. ""setting our phone screens on FIRE"" - This metaphor suggests the intense excitement and anticipation around the movie ""Pathaan"" and the eagerness to book tickets. It alludes to the frenzied promotion and celebration of the film's success, which can contribute to the exploitation of labor in the film industry.

2. ""Love"" - The metaphor of ""Film-Making is the experience of Love"" suggests a deep sense of passion and dedication towards the craft of making movies. While this metaphor conveys a positive sentiment towards the film industry, it can also mask the exploitation of labor that may be present behind the scenes.

3. ""high-octane blockbuster"" - This metaphor implies that the movie ""Pathaan"" is an explosive and highly successful film that cannot be missed. While this may be intended as a promotion for the movie, it also underscores the intense pressure and expectations placed on the labor involved in its production.

4. ""Entertainment level = Max!"" - This metaphor suggests that the movie ""Pathaan"" offers the highest level of entertainment. While this may be appealing to audiences, it can also perpetuate a culture of prioritizing profit and box office success over fair treatment of labor in the film industry.

5. ""Experience the rollercoaster ride of action and entertainment"" - This metaphor highlights the exhilarating and sometimes unpredictable nature of the movie ""Pathaan."" While it may create excitement for viewers, it also alludes to the ups and downs that laborers in the film industry may face, including long hours, low pay, and unstable working conditions.","Catchphrases related to the problem of labor exploitation and migration in the film industry:

3. Appeal to Authority: ""Mark Harper, the transport secretary, when he came into office said his absolute top priority was to solve the rail dispute… since then things have actually if anything got worse."" - @TimesRadio
4. Poisoning the Well: ""Another breathless piece of royal sycophancy: King to rescue Rishi & boost the economy. All is well in the land then."" - @ChirpyChet

Solution:

- @garyipatton: ""Well @DanielAndrewsMP you know what happened to your failed attempt to subvert Australian Sovereignty with your Chinese Mates BRI plan. Try it again and we’ll see you in prison 😡😡😡""

Remedy:
- @Seagullrm: ""#AirbusAlbo & Labor want an indigenous Voice to Parliament. Lydia Thorpe & urban activists want a treaty. The messaging coming from indigenous communities across Northern Australia is not about a Voice or treaty. They just want some hope. I think this is a good place to start.""

Canada,Canada,Discrediting opposing political parties.,"The political goal of the information operation is to discredit the CPC party and its members, particularly Pierre Poilievre, while promoting negative narratives about them.",This is a coordinated disinformation campaign targeting the CPC party and specific individuals within it by spreading false narratives and accusations.,October,"1. Criticism of conservative politicians (CPC) and their actions
2. Concerns about corruption and unethical behavior within the political system
3. Support for democratic values and opposition to authoritarianism
4. Opposition to far-right ideologies and populist rhetoric
5. Distrust of media coverage and manipulation by political parties
6. Critiques of healthcare policies and the treatment of healthcare professionals
7. Fears about the rise of nationalism and its impact on global conflicts","1. **Ad Hominem**: 
   - The posts that directly attack individuals, such as calling Doug Ford a racist and accusing the CPC of being a new Nazi Party or Nazi-like behavior, fall under this fallacy. The attacks on Pierre Polievre specifically in some posts also fall under this fallacy.
   - Example: ""Doug Ford is a racist. He is anti democracy. He is an IDU/Harper/CPC bad actor, put up by harper to destroy ontario democracy. and help destroy CDA democracy. He and harper are enemies of CDA"" 
     
2. **Appeal to Emotions**:
   - Posts that use emotionally charged language or rhetoric to sway the audience, such as calling for sanctions against CPC MPs who supported ""violent and illegal protests"" or accusing them of undermining democracy, fall under this fallacy.
   - Example: ""Conservative MP Michael Cooper couldn’t even bring himself to say no member of parliament is an 'agent of Beijing'. No one is doing China’s work for them better then Michael and @PierrePoilievre as they sow the seeds of distrust in democracy.""
   
3. **Loaded Language**:
   - Posts that use loaded or inflammatory language to create a biased or emotional response, such as labeling certain political groups or individuals as ""Nazi"" or using terms like ""conspiracy nutbars"" or ""white nationalist knuckle draggers"" to describe a certain political faction, fall under this fallacy.
   - Example: ""The #CPC is the new #NaziParty #NeverVoteConservative""

4. **Appeal to Authority**:
   - Posts that refer to the opinions or actions of authority figures, such as stating that certain media outlets are amplifying certain political figures' talking points without challenge, can fall under this fallacy.
   - Example: ""The Canadian Media is following the same path in regards to Pierre Poilievre and the CPC party. They amplify his talking points - unchallenged.""

5. **Hasty Generalization**:
   - Posts that make blanket statements about a group of people, such as claiming that the Ontario media was irresponsible in holding Doug Ford and FordNation to task or that the Canadian media is amplifying propaganda from the CPC without challenge, can fall under this fallacy.
   - Example: ""The Ontario Media was rather irresponsible when it came to holding Doug Ford and FordNation to task in the run up to the 2022 election.""

Overall, these fallacies exist in the posts due to the use of emotional language, personal attacks, sweeping generalizations, and appeals to authority or popularity without providing substantial evidence or logical reasoning.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts imply a left-leaning political culture, likely associated with the Canadian Liberal Party or New Democratic Party (NDP). 

Some of the cues and language used include: 
- Referencing specific politicians and parties like CPC (Conservative Party of Canada), Doug Ford, Pierre Poilievre, and Michael Cooper
- Use of hashtags like #CdnPoli (Canadian politics), #OnPoli (Ontario politics), and #CPCNonsense
- Labeling certain politicians as racists, anti-democracy, bad actors, Nazis, and far-right radicals
- Criticizing the actions and policies of conservative politicians and parties, such as advocating for abortion rights and opposing anti-choice views
- Mentioning specific political events and issues related to democracy, corruption, and propaganda
- Describing politicians as populists and making accusations of them undermining the healthcare system
- Using humor and sarcasm to mock conservative politicians and their supporters

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts aligns with a progressive, liberal, and anti-conservative political ideology that values social justice, democracy, and inclusivity. The language and cues used suggest a strong opposition to the Conservative Party of Canada and its associated politicians.","1. Democracy

- RT @TheEconomist As China became more deeply integrated into the global economy, many in the West predicted that it would become more democratic. The death of that hope is partly why economic conflict looks increasingly inevitable

- @PeggieFitzpat17 @merry123459 @PierrePoilievre Yup! Big different between calling out bad behaviour, and inventing situations to encourage and foment it like the CPC tends to do.

This post elicits a positive emotion by highlighting the difference between calling out bad behavior and inventing situations, which could create excitement or joy in the reader.","There are no posts using an Enhance tactic in this coordinated campaign. All the posts are focused on criticizing the CPC (Conservative Party of Canada) and its members, rather than encouraging further discussion or action on the topic of labor and migration.","The following post uses a Distort tactic by suggesting that politicians are committing crimes and corruption related to labor and migration, when the main message of the topic is not about crimes or corruption:
@soerbrenda8 Lets hope that will happen in this part of history. It feels so hard to see with all of the blatant crimes, corruption, hate that politicians are committing in our face and smearing the ones that work to stop it. It feels so hopeless.

2. RT @moralityPLS Doug Ford is a racist. He is anti democracy. He is an IDU/Harper/CPC bad actor, put up by harper to destroy ontario democracy. and help destroy CDA democracy. He and harper are enemies of CDA
   - This post diverts attention to criticizing Doug Ford and the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) instead of focusing on the topic of labor and migration.

- RT @MarkGerretsen Conservative MP Michael Cooper couldn’t even bring himself to say no member of parliament is an “agent of Beijing”. No one is doing China’s work for them better then Michael and @PierrePoilievre as they sow the seeds of distrust in democracy.

This is evident from the emphasis on Black players and fans, as well as the calls for inclusivity and community support within the team. The lack of diversity may be attributed to systemic barriers, biases in recruitment and hiring processes, and a history of unequal opportunities in sports. This has resulted in a homogenous team composition that does not accurately reflect the diversity of the community and fan base.","The remedy for the lack of diversity in the Arkansas Razorbacks sports teams mentioned in these tweets is to actively recruit, hire, and support a more diverse range of players and staff members.

Additionally, promoting and celebrating diversity within the team can help create a more inclusive and representative sports community that reflects the diversity of the fan base and broader community.

Appeal to Emotions: The post by @PennilessScribe uses emotionally charged language to entice readers to click on the link to their book.

The 3rd step is sponsoring bills to remove #CCPChina's sovereign immunity for class action lawsuits.
   Fallacy: Appeal to Consequence
   Explanation: This tweet uses the fallacy of Appeal to Consequence by suggesting that the accountability of CCP China is dependent on specific steps being taken. In reality, the accountability of a nation should not be contingent on certain actions being carried out.
   Example: ""If we don't impeach the President, then the country will never recover from this scandal.""

2. RT @ds4si Dope article bout the fam @ProjectSouth #pma #southernmovement
   Fallacy: Loaded Language
   Explanation: The use of the word ""Dope"" in this tweet can be considered a form of Loaded Language. Loaded language is a type of fallacy where emotion-evoking words or phrases are used to sway the audience's opinion.
   Example: ""The amazing new product is a must-have for everyone!""

3. RT @GordonGChang The surest way to stop #China from attacking #Taiwan is to defeat #Russia in #Ukraine. As aggressive and arrogant as #XiJinping is, he is not going to take on a determined coalition led by a resurgent #America. @marklevinshow
   Fallacy: False Dilemma
   Explanation: This tweet creates a False Dilemma by presenting only two options for preventing China from attacking Taiwan - defeating Russia in Ukraine or facing a coalition led by America. There are likely other possible approaches to prevent such an attack.
   Example: ""Either you're with us, or you're against us.""

   Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
   Explanation: This tweet uses Hasty Generalization by assuming that just because the character Eliza has been waiting for 500 years, others must also share the same length of knowledge about Night Raven College. This conclusion is drawn without sufficient evidence or reasoning.
   Example: ""Everyone in this town loves the new restaurant.""

   Fallacy: Ad Hominem
   Explanation: This tweet contains an ad hominem attack on Marcos by implying that his choice to bring 70 people to Davos is excessive compared to other countries. The argument should focus on the issue at hand rather than attacking the individual.
   Example: ""You shouldn't listen to their argument because they are hypocrites.""","1.

China,China,The type of political goal for the posts is **financial manipulation**.,The political goal of the information operation is to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and encourage people to buy it before the bullrun starts.,Description: Coordinated spam campaign promoting the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU using multiple fake accounts and influencers.,June,"The major themes from these tweets are:
1. Bullrun starting from China and the significance of focusing on OGGYINU in relation to this
2. Urging readers to not miss out on the opportunity and to buy OGGY to secure their future before the bullrun starts.","Confirmation Bias: This fallacy occurs when the writer only looks for information that confirms their preexisting beliefs, ignoring any contradictory evidence. In this case, the posts are all promoting the same cryptocurrency, #OGGYINU, based on the idea that the bullrun will start from China because #OGGYINU is focusing there. This demonstrates a confirmation bias as they only focus on information that supports their recommendation to buy #OGGYINU.

Example post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because everyone else is doing something, you should too. In these posts, there is a sense of urgency and pressure to buy #OGGYINU before the bullrun starts because others are doing the same.

Example post: ""Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade you by appealing to a famous or respected figure instead of providing valid arguments. In this case, the writers mention #CZ and suggest that the bullrun will start from China because #OGGYINU is focusing there.

Example post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection?""

In conclusion, the fallacies present in these posts are Confirmation Bias, Bandwagon, and Appeal to Authority. These fallacies exist because the writers are trying to manipulate readers into buying #OGGYINU by providing biased information, creating a sense of urgency, and appealing to the authority of #CZ.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest a community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts or investors discussing market trends and investment opportunities. The use of hashtags such as #OGGYINU, #CZ, and mentions of various cryptocurrency-related accounts like @BullzEg, @CurveNetwork, and @binancezh indicate a shared interest in the crypto market. Additionally, phrases like ""bullrun,"" ""don't be fool,"" ""secure your future,"" and ""buy #OGGY"" are common language within this community, suggesting a sense of urgency and shared investment goals.

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,Destabilization,There is no clear political goal related to labor and migration discussed in the provided posts.,The information operation is promoting the #SanctionAliyev hashtag and calling for action against the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan regarding human rights violations and aggression towards Armenia and Artsakh.,September,"- Democracy and human rights
- Ethnic cleaning
- Sanctioning Aliyev
- Airlift for NagornoKarabakh","Several fallacies from the list are present in the posts:

1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts use emotional language to garner support for their cause, such as mentioning threats to eradicate Armenian people and calling for the recognition of Artsakh.

2. Ad Hominem: The posts attack Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev, painting him as a villain and calling for sanctions against him.

3. Appeal to Authority: The posts tag various political figures and organizations, appealing to their authority to take action against Aliyev.

4. Black-or-White: The posts present a binary view of the situation, painting Aliyev as the villain and the Armenians as the victims.

Example of posts associated with these fallacies:
- ""It's the war of petrodollars and barbarism against democracy. For Human Rights to be victorious: #SanctionAliyev #RecognizeArtsakh""
- ""Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev threatens to eradicate the Armenian people. It's the war of petrodollars and barbarism against democracy. For Human Rights to be victorious: #SanctionAliyev""
- ""Aliyev is carrying out a genocide against the indigenous Armenians of Artsakh. Those supporting Azerbaijan's fascist regime are responsible for 120,000 Armenians being starved & frozen to death. #SanctionAliyev""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts suggest a pro-Armenian stance and opposition towards the Azerbaijani government, particularly President Aliyev. The culture or in-group implied by these posts include individuals who are part of the Armenian diaspora or support Armenian causes, particularly the recognition of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) as an independent state.

Key terms and hashtags such as #Artsakh, #SanctionAliyev, #StopArtsakhBlockade, and #RecognizeArtsakh indicate a strong advocacy for the recognition of Armenian rights and the condemnation of Azerbaijani actions. The posts also mention specific political figures like Emmanuel Macron and organizations such as the United Nations and European Parliament, suggesting an alignment with international bodies supporting Armenian causes.

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that values human rights, democracy, and ethnic identity for the Armenian people, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflicts in Artsakh and Armenia. The posts also highlight a sense of solidarity and activism within the Armenian community and its supporters.","- dictator

Appeal to Emotions: The post by @StanzinTondan uses emotional language, stating ""You can clean a beach – but the plastic always comes back"" and urging followers to demand support for a ""strong"" treaty. This appeal to emotions is a fallacy because it does not provide logical reasoning for supporting a Global Plastics Treaty, but rather relies on evoking emotional responses.

2. Appeal to Authority: The post by @Greenpeace states, “Why the treaty is important is it will force us to behave right, and to save this great ally that we have called the ocean."" By using Greenpeace as an authority on the topic, this post is appealing to authority to persuade followers to support the treaty.

3. False Dilemma: The tweet by @VanStreetDog presents a false dilemma by suggesting that the only solution to plastic pollution is by securing a Global Plastics Treaty. It implies that there are no other effective measures that can be taken to address the issue.

4. Appeal to Popularity: The post by @Greenpeaceafric states, ""Tell your government to support this!"" urging followers to support a Global Plastics Treaty to save the planet. By appealing to the desire to be part of a popular movement, this post is using the appeal to popularity fallacy.

5. Appeal to Tradition: The tweet by @Georges_GASSITA mentions the Basel Convention as a basis for a future treaty against plastic pollution, suggesting that this tradition or past practice should guide future actions. This is an appeal to tradition fallacy as it relies on the idea that past practices should determine current actions.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply an environmental activist or conservationist culture.

4. Emotional attachment to the characters of 1899 and desire for their stories to continue.

6. Suggestions for alternative ways to continue the story of 1899 if the show is not renewed.
7. Speculation and analysis of the show's plot and characters. 
8. Creative fan engagement with the show, such as fan-made edits and art.","1. Appeal to Emotions - Many of the posts use emotional language and hashtags like #save1899 and #renew1899 to appeal to the emotions of the readers and viewers rather than providing logical arguments for the renewal of the show.

2. Appeal to Authority - Some posts mention the creators or cast of the show as a way to lend credibility to their argument for renewing the show.
   Example: ""@NetflixDE We want to see Bo & Jantje’s 1899 again in season 2 #1899Netflix""

3. Appeal to Popularity - Multiple posts use the number of followers or signatures on petitions as a reason for why the show should be renewed, appealing to the idea that if many people want something, it must be worth keeping.

4. Appeal to Tradition - Some posts reference past seasons or episodes of the show as a reason for why it should be renewed, suggesting that because it has been popular in the past, it should continue.

   Example: ""Keep in mind they released 1899 literally 3 days before the World Cup started.""
