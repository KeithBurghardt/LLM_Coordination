Terms such as ""bokep,"" ""memek,"" ""sange,"" ""abg,"" ""vcs,"" and ""ngentot"" are used to describe explicit sexual content. The use of hashtags like #ayamkampus, #memekperawan, #memektembem, and #abgbugil further indicate the focus on young individuals and sexual acts.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely a community or network that seeks or promotes explicit and often illegal sexual content. These posts suggest involvement in the distribution or consumption of pornography or related services. The use of terms like ""VIP private room,"" ""join Chanel tele,"" and ""link full durasi video"" indicates a level of exclusivity or membership within this community. The repeated use of certain hashtags and phrases like ""sange_aaaaaaaaaah"" also suggests a shared understanding and appreciation for specific sexual preferences or acts within this group. 

It is important to note that the promotion of pornographic content and services can be illegal and harmful. It is essential to avoid engaging with or supporting such activities.","- bokep

1. Accusations of corruption and authoritarian control in relation to political decisions (e.g. tax deductibility for voting, dealings with China)
2. Criticisms of government policies and actions, particularly relating to Indigenous rights and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
3. Concerns about potential division along racial lines and the impact of certain political decisions on the country

- Fallacy: Ad Hominem (against Albozo)
- Explanation: The argument attacks Albozo personally by questioning his motives and intelligence rather than addressing the issue of tax deductibility.
- Example: ""Why should we listen to someone like Albozo? He obviously has his own agenda and thinks he's better than the rest of us.""

2. RT @HolyFukcmedead ""While the sheep are busy being distracted by Biden and the papers in the Garage rubbish... This is happening: https://t.co/xalfN6buwI""

Criticism of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and their tactics regarding media manipulation and scandals
2. Accusations of racism in reporting on Chinese interference in Canadian politics
3. Criticism of CPC leader Pierre Poilievre and accusations of lying and manipulation
4. Mention of corruption in the Alberta oil industry and political influence
5. Discussion of foreign interference by state actors, specifically the People's Republic of China
6. Criticism of the CPC's handling of healthcare and extremism issues
7. Conspiracy theories about conservative media working together to attack the Canadian government 
8. Mention of state-sponsored propaganda and manipulation tactics in politics.","1. Ad Hominem: The tweet by @NotAssangesCat uses an Ad Hominem fallacy by attacking the character of certain individuals in the Conservative Party without addressing the actual issues being discussed.

2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet by @jungle_jason uses emotive language to convey their disdain for the Conservative Party, rather than providing factual evidence or logical reasoning to support their argument.

3. False Cause: The tweet by @KevinTurnerCNJ implies a causal relationship between foreign ownership and corruption in the Alberta Oil Patch without providing any factual evidence to support this claim.

4. Ad Populum: The tweet by @sixmacs6 uses the popularity of the Conservative Party amongst women voters as a basis for an argument, without addressing the substance of the issue being discussed.

5. Red Herring: The tweet by @ou812_Kess attempts to shift the focus of the discussion from foreign interference to conspiracy theories about the media and the government, thus presenting a red herring argument.","Based on the language and cultural cues used in these posts, the implied culture or in-group is likely to be liberal or left-leaning Canadians who are critical of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members. 

Some of the cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts include:
- Referring to CPC members as ""clowns"" and ""pathetic""
- Using hashtags such as #CdnmediFailed, #CPCNonsense, and #PierrePoilievreMustGo
- Criticizing CPC members for their alleged ties to China and accusing them of being ineffective or corrupt
- Referring to CPC members as ""useless"" and accusing them of destroying healthcare for profit

Example: ""RT @messistaa13 #marcos #GH2022 https://t.co/ypSuVjqOBV""

Example: ""RT @trinoplss Marcos Week is back! ‚ú® #GranHermano #MarcosGH22 #MarcosGH23 https://t.co/rP7A662Ymh""

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when an argument relies on the opinion of someone seen as an authority figure rather than on evidence or reason.

We are going to win tomorrow right? Right!! #WPS"". The use of emotional language and the exclamation points are meant to evoke a positive emotional response from the audience, rather than providing logical reasoning.
Example: ""I can't sleep because I'm so excited about what's going to happen tomorrow! Go team!!""

- Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy exists in the post ""RT @WillMoclairTV Everyone is ready for the show #SelectionSunday #WPS"". The implication that everyone is ready for the show based on tradition or previous experiences is not a valid argument for predicting future outcomes.

China,China,Disinformation for financial gain.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is a pump and dump scheme for the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU.,Description: Coordinated promotion of the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU as a way to capitalize on the bullrun starting from China. The promotion is carried out by a network of accounts that may be part of an information operation.,July,"The major theme from the posts is the promotion of the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and the suggestion to buy it before the bullrun starts, with a focus on China as the starting point for the bullrun. The posts also highlight the importance of making a secure investment for the future.","1. Appeal to Authority - This fallacy is present in the posts that reference #CZ as a figure of authority in the cryptocurrency world. The implication is that because #CZ says the bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there, it must be true. Example post: ""@CryptoThro As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

2. Ambiguity - This fallacy occurs when the language used is vague and open to multiple interpretations. Example post: ""@WhaleChart As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

3. Confirmation Bias - This fallacy is seen in the posts that only present information that supports the claim that the bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is a good investment, while ignoring any contradictory evidence. Example post: ""@itsALLrisky As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

4. Circular Reasoning - This fallacy involves using the conclusion of the argument in the premises. Example post: ""@CryptoMiners_Co @Xprojectorg As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

These fallacies exist in the posts due to the lack of solid evidence or logical reasoning to support the claims being made. Instead, the posts rely on appeals to authority, vague language, confirmation bias, and circular reasoning to persuade readers to invest in #OGGYINU.","The culture or in-group implied by these posts includes individuals involved in cryptocurrency trading and investment, particularly in altcoins. The use of hashtags such as #CZ (referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance), references to bull runs in the market, and specific altcoin names like #OGGYINU suggest a specific niche within the cryptocurrency community that is familiar with these terms and actively engages in trading discussions and investments. The language used, such as ""secure your future before the bullrun starts"" and ""don't be fool, just buy #OGGY,"" indicates a sense of urgency and camaraderie among members of this in-group. Additionally, the repetition of certain account names and hashtags in multiple posts highlights a network of interconnected individuals within this community.","- bullrun

Remedy:
There are no tweets in the provided list that specifically mention any remedies related to crime.",The post from @michaelxpettis uses a Dismiss tactic because it dismisses the importance of banks lending for political reasons in China and for speculative activities in the US because they make little economic sense. It argues that the economic sense of these actions is not important.
China,China,Financial gain.,"The political goal of the information operation is likely to promote and manipulate the value of the cryptocurrency $pepa, positioning it as the best meme coin and encouraging people to buy it before a supposed bull run starting in China. The use of influential figures and claims about future price growth aim to drive interest and investment in $pepa.","The description of the information operation is a coordinated effort to promote the cryptocurrency $pepa as the best meme coin, with a focus on a potential bull run starting in China. Multiple accounts are used to spread this message across various platforms.","There are different posts on different topics, not all related to crime.","Some of the major themes from the tweets about the topic of crime include:
1. Promoting and discussing the potential of the meme coin $pepa as the best meme coin, suggesting a potential bullrun starting from China.
2. Mentioning the connection between the bullrun starting from China and the focus of $pepainu in that region.
3. Highlighting the need to buy $pepa to secure financial future before the bullrun starts.
4. Discussing the launch of a new utility based on AI, with marketing strategies, AI bot, Doxx KYC Audit, influencers support, and Chinese marketing, suggesting significant growth potential.
5. Mentions of various influencers, platforms, and projects in the context of the crime being discussed, such as @cz_binance, @elonmusk, @Ashcryptoreal, and others.","Here are examples of intentional fallacies found in the provided tweets:

1. Appeal to Authority fallacy: Tweet from @1MillSaviour which mentions that ""peeps been hyped lately on all the memes and especially 'Pepe' and kept saying the ''Chinese'' are coming to pump their bags and the SEC lol."" This presents the idea that the Chinese are intricately involved in promoting the meme coin, which may not be true.

2. Appeal to Popularity fallacy: The repetition of the statement ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection?"" across multiple tweets attempts to appeal to the popularity of the idea with the intention of convincing others to buy #pepa without providing substantial evidence or reasoning.

Please note that some tweets may contain additional fallacies beyond those discussed here.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include hashtags such as #pepa, #CZ, #pepainu, and references to China. These cues imply that the culture or in-group being referenced is likely involved in cryptocurrency trading, specifically focusing on meme coins and potential bull runs in the market. The language used suggests a sense of urgency and excitement around investing in these specific cryptocurrencies before the projected bull run, with an emphasis on influence from Chinese markets and influencers. The posts also reference memes, AI, KYC audits, and social media marketing as part of the cryptocurrency projects being discussed.","- China
