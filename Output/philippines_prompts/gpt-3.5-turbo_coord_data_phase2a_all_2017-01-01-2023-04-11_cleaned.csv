These posts are aimed at highlighting efforts towards building world peace and deepening cooperation in new energy, respectively, with the intention of encouraging discussion and action within the topic-group.","The posts that use a Distort tactic are the ones about irrelevant topics, like the school of fish working similarly to the human brain, China's cooperation with Iceland on new energy and cultural tourism, and the meeting between the Anyang Municipal Party Committee and the ambassador of Iceland to China about deepening cooperation.

1. ""I believe it that‚Äôs how the corruption starts.., Kari Lake Says ‚ÄòPowerful People‚Äô Recently Tried to Bribe Her to Leave Politics"" - This post distracts from the discussions about China, global security, and Taiwan by bringing up a personal anecdote about bribery in politics.

""Scientists from NASA believe that the wall of green laser beams seen over Hawaii on January 28 came from a Chinese satellite."" - This post, while related to China, talks about a completely different topic of laser beams and satellites, diverting attention from the main issue of global security and Taiwan.

3. ""BREAKING: Trump releases a statement saying the indictment against him is ""Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history."""" - This post shifts the focus to Trump's statement and allegations of persecution, which is not relevant to the discussion about China, global security, and Taiwan.

3. Conjunction: The third post involves the fallacy of conjunction, where it generalizes a group as ""CPC and hard right extremists"" without providing specific examples or evidence to support this claim.

4. Poisoning the Well: The fourth post displays the fallacy of poisoning the well by preemptively discrediting Conservative MPs as ""sowing the seeds of distrust in democracy"" without providing specific examples or evidence.

These posts bring up the related topic of Marcos and Julieta, engaging the audience by introducing another character in the discussion.","The posts that contain the hashtag #marcos and provide specific details or elaborate on the topic of Marcos can be considered to use an Explain tactic. These posts provide more information or context about Marcos, such as including emojis to express emotions or mentioning specific events related to Marcos. Other posts simply use the hashtag without providing additional details.","The posts that use an Excite tactic (elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement) are:

On the other hand, the post that mentions Marcos seeing TikTok does use a Distort tactic because it introduces a topic that is not relevant to the original discussion about Marcos and Gran Hermano.

4. College basketball and football culture in Arkansas","Some of the fallacies that can be identified in the tweets are:

- Ad Hominem: This fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than the argument itself. In the tweet by @PigTrailNation, the statement ""Potential and 2 bucks will get you a cup of coffee"" could be seen as dismissing the opinion of someone based on their perceived lack of credibility.

- Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves manipulating emotions to win an argument. In the tweet by @Omiller03, the statement ""Don't let that lil # fool u. We goin back to the Sweet 16. Let's freaking go"" appeals to the emotions of excitement and confidence to persuade others.

- Appeal to Authority: This fallacy involves appealing to an authority figure or expert for validation. In the tweet by @PigTrailNation, the mention of the impact of @CoachDanEnos on former players is an appeal to the authority of the coach.

- Composition: This fallacy involves assuming that what is true of the parts is true of the whole. In the tweet about the Razorbacks still experimenting on the offensive line, there may be a composition fallacy if generalizations are made about the entire team based on the actions of a few individuals.

These fallacies exist in the tweets because they attempt to persuade or influence the audience using faulty reasoning instead of valid arguments. They rely on emotional appeal, attacking individuals, or drawing conclusions that do not logically follow. 

Example of Ad Hominem fallacy:
- ""@PigTrailNation: Potential and 2 bucks will get you a cup of coffee."" This dismisses the credibility or potential of someone based on their perceived lack of value.

Example of Appeal to Emotions fallacy:
- ""@Omiller03: Don't let that lil # fool u. We goin back to the Sweet 16. Let's freaking go."" This uses excitement to influence others towards a particular conclusion.

Example of Appeal to Authority fallacy:
- ""@PigTrailNation: You can tell the impact @CoachDanEnos had on his former players at Arkansas."" This relies on the authority of the coach to validate a statement.

Example of Composition fallacy:
- ""#Arkansas #Razorbacks still experimenting on the offensive line."" This may imply that the actions of a part of the team reflect the entire team, which may not be accurate.","- #WPS (Woo Pig Sooie)

- RT @polijunkie_aus The framing ‚ÄúUS war on China‚Äù is misleading or worse, dishonest. The US is not invading China, or even firing the first shot. The centre issue is China‚Äôs plan to take over Taiwan, a democratic, free, self-governing island of 24 million people, an economic/technology powerhouse

This post is distorting the topic by shifting the focus from the US and China conflict to China's plan to take over Taiwan. It alters the main message by downplaying the US involvement in the situation.","The following post uses a Dismay tactic:

This post shifts the focus from the previous discussion about NPC supremacy and female republic elders to a completely different and unrelated topic of Yemen's civil war. This can be seen as an attempt to divert attention away from the original topic.

Similarly, the post by @AnnaFotyga_PE about the growing military cooperation between Russia and China is also an example of using the Distract tactic. This post introduces a new and unrelated topic that shifts the focus away from the previous discussion about NPC cookies and fan art.

1. Promoting the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU as a key investment opportunity.
2. Emphasizing that the bullrun will start from China and connecting it to the potential success of #OGGYINU.
3. Urging followers to buy #OGGYINU to secure their future before the bullrun starts.","1. Appeal to Authority fallacy: The posts suggest that because #CZ believes the bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there, it must be true.

Example post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

2. Bandwagon fallacy: The posts try to appeal to the reader's desire to fit in and not miss out on potential gains by suggesting that buying #OGGY is the right decision because others are doing it.
Example post: ""Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

3. Hasty Generalization fallacy: The posts make the assumption that just because #CZ believes the bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there, it must be true for everyone without providing sufficient evidence.
Example post: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection?""

Solution:
The remedy to the problem mentioned in the posts is to not fall for potential manipulation or misleading behavior around the promotion of the cryptocurrency OggyInu as an investment opportunity. It is advised to conduct thorough research, seek advice from legitimate sources, and make informed decisions when considering any cryptocurrency investment.

Remedy:
The main problem being mentioned explicitly or alluded to in the posts is promoting and shilling a specific cryptocurrency (OggyInu) as a potential investment opportunity, linking it to a potential bull run starting in China. This could be seen as potentially misleading or manipulative behavior within the cryptocurrency community.","The posts using a Dismiss tactic (explaining why the topic is not important) are the ones focusing on promoting the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU and the connection to the bullrun starting from China.

Begging the Question:
The post that states, ""I guess Aliyev doesn‚Äôt care. He is not used to respect international laws, conventions, human rights, ecological guidelines. He doesn‚Äôt care neither about human lives. This tyrant must be stopped #StopArtsakhBlockade #SanctionAliyev"" begs the question by assuming that Aliyev is guilty of not caring about international laws, conventions, human rights, and human lives without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim.

Ad Hominem:
The post that states, ""On February 26,1992, on the instructions of Heydar Aliyev, the 366th motorized rifle regiment of #Russia entered #Khojaly and the Khojaly genocide was committed. Later, Heydar #Aliyev sold 6 districts in #Karabakh to the Russians and became the President of #Azerbaijan in 1993 @hrw"" contains an ad hominem attack by focusing on the actions of Heydar Aliyev rather than addressing the current situation with Aliyev's regime.

Appeal to Emotions:

Example:
""@DogecoinRide As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

5. @BitcoinMagazine @IvanOnTech As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts","The posts that use the Explain tactic are spreading the message about $pepa, highlighting that the bullrun will start from China and that #pepainu is focusing there. They are emphasizing the connection and encouraging people to buy $pepa to secure their future before the bullrun starts.","Posts that use an Excite tactic (elicit a positive emotion such as joy or excitement):
- RT @luaucestari @crypto1007 @defipope @pepa_inu @MEXC_Global @MEXC_Japan @8Splinter8 @BinanceLabs @bnbbombs @BSCGemsAlert @bull_bnb @chinapumprocket Go $pepa the best meme coin üöÄüê∏üê∑üöÄ

These posts use language that aims to create excitement and enthusiasm, encouraging users to engage positively with the content.","The posts that are part of the coordinated campaign that use an enhance tactic are the ones that encourage the topic-group to continue with the topic, focusing on the benefits or potential success of the cryptocurrency $pepa. These posts emphasize the potential for growth, the involvement of Chinese investors, and the importance of buying $pepa to secure future gains.","The posts that use a Distort tactic are the ones that mention the ""CZ bullrun starting from China"" and how ""pepainu is focusing there."" This tactic is not important because it is aimed at creating hype and promoting a particular meme coin without providing any substantial or relevant information. Instead, it tries to manipulate readers by suggesting a connection between a bullrun in China and the focus on a specific coin without factual basis.","All posts are part of a coordinated campaign promoting the cryptocurrency $pepa as the best meme coin to invest in. While all posts are aligned in promoting $pepa, some may use a distort tactic by exaggerating the potential impact of the coin, specifically by linking the bullrun to China and claiming $pepa is focused there to create urgency and influence investment decisions.","The posts that use a Dismay tactic, eliciting a negative emotion such as sadness or anger, are:
1. ""Tell me if you're bullish or bearish, cause peeps been hyped lately on all the memes and especially 'Pepe' and kept saying the ''Chinese'' are coming to pump their bags and the SEC lol. You buying, selling, or just FK IT ALL and sit laid back? üòë""

3. ""@SadieCalls""

These posts create a sense of concern, unease, or negative anticipation among readers.","The posts using a Distract tactic are the ones that are about a different topic entirely, not related to the promotion of the cryptocurrency. 

For example:
RT @1MillSaviour Tell me if you're bullish or bearish, cause peeps been hyped lately on all the memes and especially 'Pepe' and kept saying the ''Chinese'' are coming to pump their bags and the SEC lol. You buying, selling, or just FK IT ALL and sit laid back? üòë

This post is talking about being bullish or bearish and the hype around different memes, with no mention of the promoted cryptocurrency.

These posts appeal to the emotions and desires of the audience to rally support for their cause without addressing the actual reasons behind the cancellation decision.

Appeal to Emotions - Emotions are heavily manipulated in these posts to create a sense of urgency and sadness over the cancellation of the show. Example: ""I hate Netflix for canceling 1899. That show has so much potential.""

Begging the Question - The posts assume that the show's cancellation was unjust or without merit, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this assumption.

Bandwagon Fallacy - This fallacy occurs when someone claims that because everyone else is doing something, you should do it too. In this case, the use of multiple accounts to repeatedly vote for #RM at the #SECAwards suggests a bandwagon fallacy, as it implies that because others are voting for him, you should too.

2. Circular Reasoning - This fallacy occurs when the conclusion of an argument is used as one of the premises. In this case, the repetition of voting for #RM at the #SECAwards without any further justification or reasoning can be seen as circular reasoning.

3. Appeal to the Gallery - This fallacy occurs when someone tries to sway an argument by appealing to the masses. The use of multiple accounts to vote for #RM at the #SECAwards could be seen as an attempt to appeal to a larger audience to influence the outcome of the voting process.

2. Appeal to Authority Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone cites an authority figure or expert as evidence for a claim, without providing any actual evidence or reasoning. In this post, the reputable football team is used as an authority and expertise in the sport, rather than providing solid reasons why signing with them is a good decision.
