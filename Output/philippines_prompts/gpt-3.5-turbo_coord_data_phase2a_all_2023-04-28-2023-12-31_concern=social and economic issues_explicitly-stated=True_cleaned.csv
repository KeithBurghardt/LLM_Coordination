United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Undermining trust in government,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to portray the Conservative party in the UK as corrupt, authoritarian, and undemocratic in order to mobilize support against them and promote a General Election.",Social and economic issues.,June,"Themes that can be derived from the posts include corruption, deceit, lies, fraud, authoritarianism, lack of accountability, trashing of democracy, government misconduct, injustice, and the mistreatment of vulnerable populations. There is also a focus on the need for investigations into potential fraud and corruption by government officials, as well as calls for a change in leadership through a general election. Additionally, the mistreatment and exploitation of indigenous peoples is highlighted in one of the tweets.","The fallacies present in the tweets are as follows:

1. Abusive Ad Hominem - The first tweet, where the user calls Boris Johnson a liar, cheat, fraud, and corrupt, is an example of an abusive ad hominem fallacy. The argument attacks the character of Johnson rather than addressing the issues.

2. Ad Hominem - The tweet where it refers to Suella Braverman as corrupt is also an example of an ad hominem fallacy. The argument attacks Braverman's character instead of addressing the topic at hand.

3. Hasty Generalization - Tweets that make broad claims about the entire Conservative Party being corrupt, such as ""Conservatives are corrupt from the top down,"" are examples of hasty generalization fallacies. These statements generalize the behavior of a few individuals to an entire group.

4. Appeal to Emotions - The tweet that states, ""But he gets to appoint a resignation list including Covid rule breakers & dodgy sycophants hours before resigning. And they keep the gongs? What a corrupt British state we live in,"" is an example of an appeal to emotions fallacy. The argument relies on emotions such as outrage rather than logical reasoning.

5. Red Herring - The tweet that talks about the SCOTUS not honoring a treaty with native Americans is an example of a red herring fallacy. The argument introduces irrelevant information about a different topic to divert attention away from the social and economic issues being discussed.

Example of posts associated with each fallacy:

1. Abusive Ad Hominem - ""I hope #BorisJohnson will go down in the history books as a liar, a cheat, a fraud, a corrupt, egotistical, self-serving narcissist, who stole the future from British youth - a stain on this country's conscience.""
2. Ad Hominem - ""Suella Braverman made front-page news 23 years ago ‚Äì accused of ‚Äòcorruption‚Äô.""
3. Hasty Generalization - ""Conservatives are corrupt from the top down.""
4. Appeal to Emotions - ""But he gets to appoint a resignation list including Covid rule breakers & dodgy sycophants hours before resigning. And they keep the gongs? What a corrupt British state we live in.""
5. Red Herring - ""Once again the SCOTUS decided not to honor another treaty with native Americans.""","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts include:
1. #ToriesOut - referring to the Conservative Party in the UK, implying a left-leaning or anti-Conservative political stance.
2. #RejoinEU - implying support for rejoining the European Union, suggesting a pro-EU stance.
3. Mention of specific politicians like Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, and Suella Braverman, along with accusations of corruption and deceit, implying a belief in dishonesty among certain political figures.
4. Calling the government criminal, greedy, and corrupt, suggesting a negative view of the current political leadership.
5. Use of hashtags like #GeneralElectionNow and calls for investigations into possible fraud and corruption, indicating a desire for political change and accountability.
6. Criticism of the police and government, with references to authoritarianism and violations of rights, suggesting a belief in oppressive government tactics.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely one that is critical of the current Conservative government in the UK, supportive of left-leaning or progressive political ideologies, and concerned about issues such as corruption, dishonesty in politics, and social justice. They may also feel marginalized or disenfranchised by the current political system and voicing their dissent through social media platforms.","- liar, cheat, fraud, corrupt, deceit, corruption

China.,China,The type of political goal for these posts is likely to raise awareness or support for a specific individual or group within the social and economic issues realm.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to generate support and positive sentiment for Lucas as a solo artist, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei among the ""Lumis"" community.","Description: Coordinated social media campaign to support artist Lucas returning as a soloist, using various accounts to amplify the message.",The starting month of the information operation is March.,"The major themes from the posts are:

1. Support and welcome back for Lucas as a solo artist
2. Identity and recognition as Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei
3. Unity and loyalty among Lumis/Fans of Lucas
4. Importance of individual subunits within a larger group or industry
5. Celebration and promotion of solo artist activities and releases","1. Bandwagon Fallacy: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim is true or good because many people believe it or practice it. In this case, the posts are all expressing support for Lucas, claiming that ""Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi, and Wong Yukhei."" This appeals to the idea that since many people are expressing support, it must be the right thing to do.

Example: ""@NNARROWSPACE @jijelaic WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when someone attempts to manipulate emotions in order to win an argument, rather than using valid reasoning. In this case, the posts are using emotive language to express support for Lucas and appeal to the emotions of the readers.

Example: ""@haeluvieee WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is traditional or has been done a certain way for a long time, it must continue to be done that way. In this case, the posts are emphasizing the past support for Lucas and urging continued support in the future.

Example: ""@444feed let's show our support for lucas üíõ quote or reply with the tags üëá Lucas is going to be active as a solo artist from now on. WELCOME BACK LUCAS ü¶Å Lumis will always support you as Lucas, Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei üíõ #SoloistLucas #LUCAS #ÈªÑÊó≠ÁÜô""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts indicate that the culture or in-group being referenced is fans of the artist Lucas, also known as Huang Xuxi or Wong Yukhei. The term ""Lumis"" is used to refer to fans of Lucas, suggesting that it is a fan group or fandom community. The use of emojis like ü¶Å and the hashtag #SoloistLucas further indicate the specific context of the posts, which are celebrating Lucas' return as a solo artist. Additionally, the use of the color yellow symbolizes support for Lucas. This group of fans seems to have a strong sense of community and support for their favorite artist, using specific language and symbols to express their unity and loyalty.","1. Huang Xuxi

3. Appeal to Vanity: The posts appeal to people's vanity by using terms like ""VIP"" and ""exclusive group,"" making individuals feel special and important if they join.

4. Group Think: By using similar language, hashtags, and content, the posts encourage conformity and discourage independent thinking, promoting a group mentality.

6. Name Calling: The posts use derogatory terms and labels to attack or belittle individuals or groups, rather than engaging in respectful and constructive dialogue.

7. Red Herring: The posts distract from the main topic of social and economic issues by redirecting attention to explicit content and encouraging joining a VIP group.

8. Straw Man: The posts create a distorted or exaggerated version of the argument, focusing on explicit content and membership to a VIP group rather than addressing real social and economic issues.
Example: ""RT @kontenasyik21 Link full durasi video: https://t.co/gBP4dKqo66 Full durasi video join VIP grup Info join : https://t.co/eH8E8hCEIa #memekperawan #memektembem #memekbasah #openvcs #vcsreal #abgbugil #abgsange #abgcolmek #sange #sange_aaaaaaaaaah #bahancoli #ngewe #ngentod #ngentotmemek""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a culture or in-group related to adult content or pornography.

Smith & Poilievre are aligned with a lot of the same policies, which are dangerous.

Fallacy: Ad Hominem
Explanation: This tweet attacks the character and policies of certain individuals (Smith & Poilievre) without providing substantial evidence to support their claims.

2. RT @GSmurfet: Poilievre's contempt for ""criminals"" he sees as subhuman, regardless of circumstances. Keep them locked up and cut off safe supply without guaranteed social support and treatment. Our Charter and justice at arm's length from gov't? Not an option for CPC.

Fallacy: Straw Man
Explanation: This tweet mischaracterizes Poilievre's views on criminal justice and exaggerates his stance to make it easier to attack. It does not accurately reflect his actual statements or policies.

3. RT @KathrynMathias1: Compare this to Poilievre's rage-farming, misleading, fear-mongering, angry post. Who do you think is a better leader - our current PM who is appreciative of Cdns and wishing us peace and good govt? or the CPC leader who continuously trashes our country and promotes disinfo?

Fallacy: False Dilemma
Explanation: This tweet presents a false dilemma by suggesting that there are only two options for leadership - the current PM or the CPC leader. It oversimplifies the situation and ignores other potential leaders or parties.

Explanation: This tweet appeals to the authority of a specific individual (Freeland) to make claims about their abilities and accomplishments. It does not provide solid evidence to support these claims.

5. RT @mini_bubbly: Poilievre and the rest of the CPC party have voted against help for Seniors, Child Care and Dental and stated they would repeal all agreements if they came to power.

Fallacy: Misleading Vividness
Explanation: This tweet presents a vivid description of the actions of Poilievre and the CPC without providing specific examples or evidence to support the claims made. It uses emotionally charged language to sway opinion without solid justification.","- The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts suggest that the culture or in-group implied is one that is critical of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and specific politicians associated with it, such as Pierre Poilievre.

- Criticisms of the CPC for their stance on issues like healthcare, foreign interference, abortion, and senior care also indicate that the implied culture or in-group values policies that prioritize the well-being and rights of citizens.

4. ""Fifth Column"" - this metaphor represents American sellouts who are seen as assets of the Chinese Communist Party, highlighting the issue of CCP influence and control.

5. ""The biggest threat to #Australia‚Äôs #NationalSecurity is its largest trading partner - #China"" - this metaphor emphasizes the threat posed by China's military build-up to Australia's national security.

Appeal to Authority: This fallacy may exist in the post that mentions ""future Arkansas WR Courtney Crutchfield"" being ranked as the #64 overall recruit in the country. The use of rankings and statistics to establish credibility and authority in this context could fall under the appeal to authority fallacy.

2. Appeal to Tradition: The post that encourages a player, @TjLindsey_, to ""stay home and put on for the 501"" could be considered an appeal to tradition fallacy. It relies on the tradition and loyalty to a certain location rather than focusing on the player's own interests or opportunities.

3. Bandwagon: The post that states, ""Hogs add talented linebacker from the transfer portal"" could potentially fall under the bandwagon fallacy. By highlighting the addition of a talented player, it may be attempting to appeal to popular opinion and encourage others to support the team.

4. Ad Verecundiam: The post congratulating @AnthonyBlack24_, @lif3nick, and @jordanwalshlife, and mentioning @EricPMusselman could be an example of the ad verecundiam fallacy. It appeals to the authority and success of the mentioned individuals to emphasize the success of the Arkansas Razorbacks.

3. Implication that there is a connection between the bullrun starting in China and the focus on #OGGYINU.
4. Hype and urgency in the messages to buy #OGGY before the bullrun starts.
5. Reference to a figure named #CZ as a source predicting the bullrun starting in China.","The fallacies present in the posts are Appeal to Authority and Bandwagon.

- Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when the speaker refers to an authority figure as a way to validate their argument, rather than providing concrete evidence. In this case, the use of ""#CZ"" as a reference to a figure of authority in the crypto world is an appeal to authority fallacy.

Example: ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

- Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when the speaker argues that something must be true or good because many other people agree with it. The posts are trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that everyone is buying #OGGY and that the bullrun will start soon, therefore you should also buy to secure your future.

Example: ""Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts"" 

These fallacies exist to manipulate the audience into making decisions based on emotion or authority rather than logic and evidence. In this case, they are used to create FOMO (fear of missing out) and drive more people to invest in #OGGY.","The cultural cues or in-group language being used in these posts suggest that the culture or in-group implied is the cryptocurrency community or investors in the cryptocurrency market. Terms like #OGGYINU, #CZ (likely referring to a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world), ""bullrun,"" and references to buying and securing future wealth through #OGGY suggest a specific subset of individuals who are actively involved in and knowledgeable about cryptocurrency trading.

Armenia,Azerbaijan,Discrediting political opponents in order to gain support.,"The political goal of the information operation is to portray Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev as corrupt, aggressive, and responsible for human rights abuses, war crimes, and a blockade of Artsakh. The goal is to incite condemnation, sanctions, and a cut in military aid to Azerbaijan.",The description of the information operation for the posts is to spread anti-Azerbaijan and anti-Aliyev propaganda related to the Artsakh conflict.,None.,"The major themes from the posts are international condemnation of Azerbaijan's President Aliyev for aggression, war crimes, and human rights abuses against Armenian Christians in Artsakh, calls for sanctions against Azerbaijan, highlighting the Armenian population suffering due to the blockade imposed by Aliyev regime, accusations of incitement of anti-Armenian hatred and genocide by Aliyev, and skepticism towards peace talks with Azerbaijan due to ongoing violence and blockades.","1. Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when someone attacks the character or circumstances of an individual rather than addressing the actual argument being made. This fallacy can be observed in tweets that focus on personal attacks on President Aliyev of Azerbaijan instead of engaging with the social and economic issues at hand.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves using emotions to persuade an audience rather than providing valid reasoning. The tweets that appeal to emotions by highlighting human rights abuses and war crimes may fall into this category.

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy occurs when someone relies on the opinion of an authority figure to validate their argument rather than providing logical reasoning. Tweets that mention the leadership of certain politicians or organizations as evidence may fall into this category.

4. False Cause: This fallacy involves mistakenly assuming that one event caused another without sufficient evidence. Tweets that blame President Aliyev for the social and economic issues without clear causal connections may fall into this category.

5. Sweeping Generalization: This fallacy occurs when someone makes a broad, sweeping statement that lacks nuance or evidence. Tweets that make generalized negative statements about Azerbaijan and its leadership may fall into this category.

Example:
Tweets that directly criticize President Aliyev's actions and character without providing concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims may be guilty of using the Ad Hominem fallacy. For instance, a tweet that reads, ""The genocidal Aliyev regime continues to oppress the Armenian population in Artsakh without mercy"" would be an example of this fallacy.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply an Armenian cultural group. The posts consistently refer to the Armenian community, Artsakh, Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, and Aliyev regime. References to the indigenous Christian Armenians, Armenian community in California, and calls for sanctions against Aliyev indicate a strong sense of unity and identity within the Armenian cultural group. The use of specific hashtags like #ArtsakhTweet, #ArtsakhBlockade, and #StopArtsakhBlockade further reinforces the cultural cues and in-group language being used to express solidarity and advocate for specific political actions in favor of the Armenian cause.","- Aggression

2. Discussion of the strong bond between the cast of 1899 and fans' appreciation for it.
3. Fans expressing their commitment to rewatching or supporting the show despite its cancellation.

This post is appealing to the emotions of the audience by emphasizing the happiness and special bond associated with the show.

- Red Herring: This fallacy could be present in posts that divert attention from the main issue of social and economic issues towards personal feelings about the show ""1899"". For example, ""I canceled my Netflix and Disney+ this past month. I never watch them. Only streaming I need are ESPN+ and Paramount. If Netflix starts producing good shows again maybe I'll return. Killing 1899 was the final straw. Only kept it because my sister was using it."" This post brings up the cancellation of the show as a reason for canceling their subscription, which detracts from the main topic of discussion.

- Appeal to the People: This fallacy can be seen in posts that imply a widespread opinion or belief among fans of the show ""1899"". For example, ""Just binge watched 1899 on Netflix. Proper mad. Set up nicely for another series then found out it's been cancelled. Boooo."" This post suggests that the cancellation of the show is disappointing based on the poster's reaction and implies that many others feel the same way.

- Ad Hominem: This fallacy could be present in posts that attack or belittle individuals or groups based on their support or lack thereof for the show ""1899"". For example, ""the likes.... all of you are fake fans cos you let 1899 die when she was DARK‚Äôs little sister.""

Brazil,Brazil,To manipulate voting results for the #SECAwards.,"The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to manipulate voting and increase support for a specific candidate (#RM) at the #SECAwards, likely with the aim of boosting their popularity and influence in the social and economic realm.",Coordinated hashtag voting campaign for #RM at #SECAwards,November.,"The major themes from the posts are:
1. Voting for RM for Artista Asiatico at the SECAwards
2. Mention of Marcos in relation to the voting
3. The use of hashtags and Twitter handles to show support for the vote
4. Reference to the 2023 SECAwards
5. Involvement of multiple Twitter users in the voting process.","1. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or well-liked, it must be true or good. In this case, the individual is trying to influence the outcome of the vote by repeatedly mentioning the candidate's name and spreading it across social media.
Example: @knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards marcos

2. Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is popular or commonly accepted, it must be true or good. In this case, the individual is trying to create a sense of momentum around a specific candidate by encouraging others to vote for them.
Example: @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that something is best or correct because it is traditional or has always been done that way. In this case, the individual is referencing past practices as a reason to vote for a particular candidate.
Example: @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos

These posts imply a culture or in-group related to K-pop, specifically fans of the K-pop artist RM (who is a member of the group BTS).

The use of specific user handles and hashtags related to K-pop and BTS suggest that the individuals posting these tweets are part of the BTS fandom or ARMY (Adorable Representative MC for Youth) community. The inclusion of the term ""Artista Asiatico"" also indicates a focus on Asian artists and likely a global perspective on music and entertainment.
