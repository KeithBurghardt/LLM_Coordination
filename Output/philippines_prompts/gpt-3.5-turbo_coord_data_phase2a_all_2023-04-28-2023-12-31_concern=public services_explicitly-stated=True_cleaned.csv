2. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet from @ashoswai evokes emotion by presenting a biased and emotionally charged narrative about a political situation related to public services.
Example: ""Three years ago, on this day China killed 20 Indian soldiers, captured more than 100 Indian soldiers, and occupied large Indian controlled territories. Modi has not got the guts to name China even once. Who is anti-national?""

3. Ignoratio Elenchi: The tweet from @lycaproductions promotes a movie sequel without addressing or relating to the topic of public services.
Example: ""Catch #PS2 in theatres near you! Book your tickets for #PS2 now! üîó""

4. False Equivalence: The tweet from @AG_knocks presents a list of statements as if they are equivalent in terms of importance or validity, which may be misleading when discussing important public service issues.
Example: ""The world according to Sanghis: 1. Jack Dorsey is lying 2. China didn't occupy any territory of India 3. Adani is clean 4. Manipur is peaceful...""

- Concerns about the treatment of fish and marine life near nuclear power plants

- Mentioning Lucas' different names and aliases (Huang Xuxi, Wong Yukhei)
- Using emojis like ü¶Å and üíõ

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely a fan community or fandom dedicated to supporting and following the activities of Lucas (also known as Huang Xuxi and Wong Yukhei) as a solo artist.

Disinformation and propaganda in politics
2. Criticism of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members

4. Allegations of foreign interference and corruption within the CPC
5. Calls for accountability and fact-checking within the political sphere","1. Appeal to Emotions: The tweet by Charlie85915085 is using fear and hate to promote a specific viewpoint and attack a politician, which can be considered an appeal to emotions fallacy.
Example: ""Poilievre is angering white supremacists & so-called Christians then directing their hate. Just like Trump and his #MAGAMoron cult. This is how Authoritarian losers get votes. Use fear to promote hate.""

2. Ad Hominem: The tweet by mini_bubbly is attacking Pierre Poilievre's character rather than addressing the actual issue, which is a common form of ad hominem fallacy.
Example: ""Here is the problem with the CPC, BLOC, rejecting the David Johnston interference report: In 2007-when Johnston was appointed to do the inquiry surrounding the Mulroney government, none of the parties had any issues, even though Johnston has been with the party his whole /1""

3. Appeal to Authority: The tweet by DougEyolfson is using the authority of being a physician to support a specific political agenda, which can be seen as an appeal to authority fallacy.
Example: ""Pierre Poilievre and the CPC are jeopardizing the lives of vulnerable people for a political agenda. As a physician, I am proud to support a government that uses evidence-based decision making.""

4. Straw Man: The tweet by merry123459 is misrepresenting Pierre Poilievre's actions and intentions in order to attack him, which is an example of a straw man fallacy.
Example: ""This is why many far right wing supporters don‚Äôt trust Poilievre. He gets them pumped up, riled up and believing his BS and then doesn‚Äôt follow through with a solution. He drops the ball. Let‚Äôs be honest, this makes Poilievre look really guilty of Chinese interference himself.""","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts suggest that the culture or in-group implied is one that is critical of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and its members. This group appears to be left-leaning, progressive, and supportive of the Liberal Party of Canada or other similar political ideologies. Some key terms and cues used include:

- Criticizing Pierre Poilievre, a member of the CPC, and suggesting he is unfit for leadership.
- Referencing specific political events and figures within the Canadian political landscape, such as Danielle Smith, the United Conservative Party (UCP), and the Canadian Premier of Alberta.
- Using hashtags like #PierrePoilievreIsLyingToYou and #PierrePoilievreMustResign to express disapproval of the CPC and its members.
- Referring to specific political scandals or controversies, such as foreign interference investigations, to highlight perceived flaws within the CPC.
- Using terms like ""MAGA Moron cult"" and ""white supremacists"" to draw parallels between the CPC and the far-right or American conservative movements.
- Criticizing the CPC's handling of public services and budgeting decisions.

Overall, the language and cues in these posts suggest a strong alignment with progressive, anti-Conservative political views and a critical stance towards the CPC and its members.","1. #CovidIsNotOver

Appeal to Emotions: The posts appeal to emotions by using phrases like ""weaponized the DOJ,"" ""Communist China deployed several military bases,"" and ""CCP is operating on American soil."" This is meant to evoke fear and anger in the audience.
2. Appeal to Force: There is an implied threat of force in the statement ""Miles Guo could expose them all!"" suggesting that action must be taken to free Miles Guo.
3. Appeal to Tradition: The post mentions the establishment of a democratic system of one person, one vote, which appeals to the traditional democratic values as opposed to CCP's system.
4. Appeal to Unqualified Authority: Referring to Miles Guo as the ""first whistleblower who alerted the world about CCP‚Äôs Spy base"" implies that Guo is an authority figure on the topic.
5. Black-or-White: The posts paint a simplistic view of the situation, dividing it into good (American patriots, Miles Guo) and evil (CCP, corrupt politicians), without acknowledging the complexities of international relations.
6. False Cause: Blaming the Biden administration for the situation without providing concrete evidence links two unrelated events (Chinese spy base in Cuba and DOJ silencing Miles Guo).
7. Guilt by Association: Linking the DOJ's actions to corrupt politicians and CCP spies implies guilt by association, without providing evidence of direct connections.
8. Ignoratio Elenchi: The posts stray from the topic of public services and focus on political conspiracies and international relations, diverting attention from the main issue.
9. Red Herring: Bringing up the issue of CCP spies and Miles Guo in the context of public services is a red herring meant to distract from the main topic at hand.
10. Straw Man: Creating a false narrative that the Biden administration ignored warnings and jailed those who called them out shifts the focus away from the real issues at hand.

1. Criticism of Aliyev's regime and actions, including attacks on Armenia and the blockading of Nagorno-Karabakh.
2. Calls for sanctions and condemnation of Aliyev for human rights violations and war crimes.
3. Expressions of concern about the lack of peace and dialogue between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
4. Mention of the need for international organizations to take action against Aliyev.
5. Disapproval of the behavior and actions of Aliyev and his regime, including incitement of anti-Armenian hatred and violence.
6. Condemnation of the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh and a village in Azerbaijan.","1. Abusive Ad Hominem - This fallacy can be seen in the post: ""@byeeeefelicia Hey dum-dum you don‚Äôt get it right? Here let me spell it for you. You are a lying paid Aliyev troll."" The fallacy occurs because the person is attacking the individual rather than addressing the actual argument being made.

2.

FYI: @JoeBiden @SecBlinken @PowerUSAID."" The fallacy occurs because the argument attacks the character of Ilham Aliyev rather than addressing the argument or issues at hand.

The fallacy occurs because the argument relies on emotions rather than logic or reasoning to make a point.

4. Appeal to Force - This fallacy can be seen in the post: ""Aliyev has already spoken."" The fallacy occurs because the argument implies that because Aliyev has spoken, there is no need for further discussion or debate.

5. Appeal to Ignorance - This fallacy can be seen in the post: ""You are a lying paid Aliyev troll."" The fallacy occurs because the argument assumes that the person is lying without any evidence to support the claim.

6. Appeal to Tradition - This fallacy can be seen in the post: ""Authoritarian #Azerbaijan. Ordinal #Azeriwarcrime towards Armenian female soldier who was tortured, mutilated, raped and killed during the September 2022 üá¶üá≤üá¶üáø war in the city of #Jermuk.""

Brazil,Brazil,Targeted social media influence for a specific candidate.,"The political goal of the information operation is to influence the outcome of the #SECAwards by promoting a specific candidate, RM, for Artista Asiatico.",Covert online influence operation using multiple fake accounts to promote a specific individual for an award.,Starting month: October,"The major themes from the given posts are:
1. Voting for RM for Artista Asiatico at the SECAwards
2. Mentioning Marcos in relation to the voting
3. Encouraging others to retweet the vote
4. Specifying the year of the SECAwards as 2023.","In the provided posts, the fallacies of Appeal to the Masses, Appeal to Emotions, and Bandwagon can be identified.

1. @knj_brasil @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos
- Fallacy: Appeal to the Masses (Ad Populum)
Explanation: The person is appealing to the masses by using the term ""vote"" in combination with a popular hashtag to influence others to vote for their preferred candidate based on popularity rather than merit.

2. @knj_brasil @secawards marcos I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards + RT
- Fallacy: Bandwagon
Explanation: The person is using the bandwagon fallacy by implying that since others are voting for #RM, the person should also vote for him to be part of the winning team or trend.

3. @demonarmys @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at #SECAwards Marcos
- Fallacy: Appeal to Emotions
Explanation: The person is appealing to emotions by using the hashtag #RM to invoke emotions associated with the candidate and potentially sway others to vote based on feelings rather than rational judgment. 

Example post for Appeal to the Masses:
""@knj_brasil @secawards I vote #RM for #ArtistaAsiatico at the 2023 #SECAwards Marcos""
- This post uses the appeal to the masses fallacy by combining the voting hashtag with the candidate's name and a popular event to influence others to vote based on the candidate's popularity rather than qualifications.","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts are related to the K-pop fan community, specifically fans of the artist RM from the group BTS. The usernames such as @knj_brasil, @demonarmys, @secawards, @KOOKSCHXSE, @kiminjoonies, and @JJK_lirio all suggest that the posters are fans of BTS or its members.

The hashtag #RM is referring to the BTS member RM, and ""ArtistaAsiatico"" translates to ""Asian Artist,"" which implies that the award being voted for is related to Asian artists. The repetition of ""Marcos"" in some of the tweets could be a reference to a specific campaign or strategy within the fan community to vote for RM.

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts is the BTS fan community, specifically fans who are actively engaged in supporting RM for an award at the SECAwards.","Language motifs mentioned in the tweets include hashtags such as #RM, #ArtistaAsiatico, #SECAwards, and mentions of the name Marcos.",None of the posts use an Engage tactic of bringing up a related but relevant topic.

1. Military activities and maritime security in the Asia-Pacific region
2. China's influence and relationships with neighboring countries
3. India's defense capabilities and foreign policy strategies
4. Border conflicts and territorial sovereignty
5. Global and regional relationships and alliances
6. Impact of technology and digital routes
7. Impact of Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical events on global consciousness

RT @Spriter99880 The two women's of war - Hillary Clinton and Chrystya Freeland - sit and talk about how the war in Ukraine is THEIR deterrence signals to China. https://t.co/Wl6k7lodIH
- Fallacy: Conspiratorial Thinking
- Explanation: The post implies that Hillary Clinton and Chrystya Freeland are somehow orchestrating the war in Ukraine for their own purposes, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning.
- Example: ""Hillary Clinton and Chrystya Freeland are secretly collaborating to escalate conflicts in Ukraine to send signals to China without anyone knowing.""

- Fallacy: Fearmongering
- Explanation: The post creates a sense of fear by highlighting military activities in the Coco Islands and suggests that India is compelled to increase its military capabilities as a result.
- Example: ""India must urgently strengthen its military power in response to increased activities in the Coco Islands to protect its interests.""
