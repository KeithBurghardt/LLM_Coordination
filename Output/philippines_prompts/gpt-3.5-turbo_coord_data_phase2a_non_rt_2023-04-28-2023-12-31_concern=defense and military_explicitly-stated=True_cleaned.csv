United Kingdom,UK,Political goal: Undermining trust in the current government and calling for a change in leadership through a general election.,"The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to portray the Conservative government as corrupt and unfit to govern, specifically targeting Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson.","Information Operation: Anti-Tory, Anti-Government, Anti-Corruption.",May,"1. Corruption and fraud within the Conservative government and calls for accountability.
2. Lack of transparency, integrity, and honesty in politics.
3. Despair over the state of the world and hope for change.
4. Allegations of shady dealings with major donors and government officials.
5. Criticism of the Conservative party and calls for a General Election.
6. Anger towards corrupt politicians taking advantage of government funds for personal gain.
7. Concerns about the emergence of Covid with potential links to Chinese military and secret experiments.
8. Mention of specific individuals like Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson, and Michelle Mone in relation to corruption and fraud allegations.
9. Desire for politicians to be held accountable and for a more honorable political system.
10. Calls for criminal proceedings for corrupt politicians.","- Ad Hominem: There are multiple instances of ad hominem fallacies in these posts, where individuals attack the character of politicians rather than their arguments or policies. For example, the post that states, ""Two major donors to the Conservatives... had direct access to Hancock, and used it to promote companies offering Covid services with which they were involved... #Corruption"" is an ad hominem attack that focuses on the donors and their connections rather than addressing the specific issue at hand.

- Appeal to Emotions: Several posts appeal to emotions to sway opinions, such as ""Corrupt politicians are as thick as thieves. They’ll stick up for each other while milking government funds for their own benefit."" This is an appeal to emotions as it tries to evoke a negative emotional response towards politicians without providing factual evidence.

- Appeal to Force: The post that states, ""The reports on the emergence of Covid become even more damning, with links to Chinese military, secret Chinese experiments to create more deadly variants, USA funding and refusal to release secret US files."" This statement appears to be an appeal to force by trying to incite fear or concern regarding potential actions related to national security and the Covid pandemic.

- Biased Sample: The consistent focus on corruption and negative actions of politicians from a specific party (Conservatives) in the posts suggests a biased sample. For example, the post that mentions specific donors to the Conservatives and their actions may be using a biased sample to portray all Conservative politicians in a negative light.

- False Equivalence: Some posts attempt to equate certain actions or individuals, such as ""We just want honesty, transparency, integrity and honour in our politicians. We want to be able to call them statesmen & women. There is ZERO chance of that with these corrupt Tories."" This statement presents a false equivalence between the desired traits in politicians and a specific political party.

- Red Herring: The post that brings up the emergence of Covid and links to the Chinese military and US funding appears to be a red herring, as it introduces irrelevant information to divert attention from the main topic of discussion, which seems to be corruption and potential investigations into specific politicians.","- #ToryScum, #ToriesOut331, #ToriesOut329, #GTTO, #ToryWipeout, #GeneralElectionNow, #CorruptTories, #TraitorousTories, #TreasonousTories, #TakingBritishPublicForMugs, #LeGuillotine, #ProportionalRepresentation, #ToryCriminals, #SlavaUkraine, #Corruption
- In-group language: Demands for a General Election, criticism of the Conservative Party, accusations of corruption and fraud, calls for accountability and investigation.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is a group of individuals who are critical of the Conservative Party (Tories) in the UK government. They believe that the party is corrupt, engaged in fraud and dishonest practices, and unfit to govern. They are calling for a General Election to remove the current government from power and bring about change. They also seem to support the Labour Party as an alternative to the Conservatives.

The posts raise concerns about unethical behavior, lack of qualifications and performance evaluation in appointments, abuse of power, and the need for thorough investigation and consequences for corrupt actions.","1. Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the first, second, fourth, and fifth posts where the individuals targeted are attacked personally rather than addressing the actual arguments being made.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be seen in all the posts as they use emotional language and derogatory terms to persuade readers rather than providing logical reasoning.

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy is present in the third post where the individual is calling for action based on the authority of investigating and charging corrupt individuals.

4. Red Herring: This fallacy can be observed in the fifth post where the individual brings up an unrelated issue about the DNA of Mr. Pascoe in a discussion about defense and military.

Example of posts associated with each fallacy:
- Ad Hominem: ""The Sleeper™ @Curtis_Pitt_MP got drunk, slept in & was hungover at work. Resign #duds #corruption #thevibe #qldpol""
- Appeal to Emotions: ""We need lockdowns. This flu sounds worse than covid. It makes people skip work & take leave for mental health issues.""
- Appeal to Authority: ""Then investigate it and remove and charge anyone that knew and never said anything now and also then. I don’t care what side of politics any corrupt should go LNP, ALP all of them. U agree right both sides all should go if they knew?""

The culture or in-group implied by these posts appears to be aligned with a group of people who are critical of the government in Queensland, particularly calling for resignations due to perceived corruption or incompetence.

2. Military Bases: Communist China has deployed several military bases in countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, and the Bahamas.
3. Threat to US Security: The CCP aims to replace the United States as the world's dominant power and spread its authoritarian values globally.
4. Whistleblower Silencing: Miles Guo, who first alerted the world about the CCP's threats, has been silenced by the DOJ.
5. Spy Activities: There are numerous CCP spies working in the US, and the CCP is involved in stealing military-related technology.","The following fallacies exist in the posts provided:

1. Appeal to Emotions - The posts appeal to emotions by using language such as ""enlistment"" and ""infiltration"" to provoke fear and anger in the audience.
2. Appeal to Authority - The posts often refer to named individuals such as ""Miles Guo"" and government officials to give credibility to their claims.
3. Ad Hominem - The posts attack the Department of Justice (DOJ) for silencing the whistleblower Miles Guo without providing sufficient evidence or context.
4. Bandwagon - The posts try to create a bandwagon effect by tagging multiple government officials and news outlets to show support for their cause.
5. Slippery Slope - The posts use language such as ""control and enslavement"" and ""spreading authoritarian values"" to suggest a drastic progression if action is not taken against the CCP.

- Post 1: ""The Seven Deadly Sins of the CCP’s Infiltration of the United States Money CorruptionThe Communist Party uses American money to corrupt US government officials and elites to achieve the purpose of control and enslavement""

- ""Playing BGY tactics"" - referring to the tactics of blackmail, graft, and extortion used by the CCP, comparing their methods to a strategic game or manipulation.
- ""Cargo ships...full of military devices"" - describing the cargo ships as carrying hidden military equipment, implying a covert and potentially dangerous operation.
- ""American proxies working on behalf of the CCP"" - likening individuals working for the CCP to proxies or representatives, suggesting a level of control and manipulation.

United States,Russia,Promoting military strength and intervention.,To promote pro-military sentiment and support for defense spending.,Propaganda campaign promoting military strength and preparedness.,July,"1. ""We must always be prepared to defend our country and protect our freedom. The brave men and women in our military deserve our support and respect. #defense #military""

2. ""The sacrifices made by our military members cannot be understated. They put their lives on the line every day to protect our country and uphold our values. #respect #honor""

3. ""National security is a top priority. Our defense and military capabilities must be strong and up to date to deter threats and protect our citizens. #nationalsecurity #strength""

4. ""The defense budget plays a critical role in ensuring our military is properly equipped and supported. We must prioritize funding for our forces to maintain readiness and effectiveness. #budget #readiness"" 

The major themes from these posts are: 
1. Support and respect for the military
2. Sacrifice and bravery of military members
3. National security and strength
4. Importance of adequate funding and readiness for the military.","1. ""We need to increase our military spending to protect our country from all potential threats. Anyone who disagrees is unpatriotic and doesn't care about our safety.""

- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: This post attacks anyone who disagrees with the argument for increasing military spending as unpatriotic, rather than addressing the actual points of contention.
- Example: ""Anyone who doesn't support increasing our military funding is just a coward and doesn't care about our country's security.""

2. ""If we don't invest in new defense technology, we'll fall behind other countries and become vulnerable to attack. We must prioritize this investment to ensure our safety.""

- Fallacy: Slippery Slope
- Explanation: This post suggests that not investing in new defense technology will inevitably lead to vulnerability and attack, without considering other factors that may impact national security.
- Example: ""If we don't upgrade our military equipment now, we'll be defenseless and easily overtaken by our enemies in the future.""

3. ""Our military has always been the strongest in the world, so there's no need to make any changes or increase funding. We can rely on our past success to protect ourselves.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition
- Explanation: This post argues that because the military has always been strong in the past, there is no need to make any changes or improvements in the present or future.
- Example: ""Our military has been the best for decades, so there's no need to change anything now. We'll always be the strongest.""

4. ""The military leaders have all endorsed the new defense strategy, so we should trust their expertise and support it without question.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
- Explanation: This post relies on the endorsement of military leaders to validate the new defense strategy, without providing evidence or reasoning to support its effectiveness.
- Example: ""The generals all agree on the new defense plan, so we should just trust them and follow their lead without questioning it.""

5. ""If we don't increase our defense budget, we won't be able to properly protect our citizens and ensure national security. It's a matter of life and death.""

- Fallacy: Appeal to Emotions
- Explanation: This post appeals to the emotions of fear and concern for safety to justify the argument for increasing defense spending, without providing factual evidence or logical reasoning.
- Example: ""If we don't boost our military budget, we're putting our country at risk of attack and endangering the lives of our citizens. We must act now to protect them.""","1. ""Semper Fi! Thank you to all the brave men and women serving in our armed forces. #supportthetroops #semperfidelis""

Cultural cues/in-group language: ""Semper Fi"" (short for Semper Fidelis, the motto of the United States Marine Corps), ""armed forces,"" ""support the troops""

Culture/in-group implied: This post is likely from someone who has a connection to the military, particularly the Marine Corps. They are part of a culture that values loyalty, bravery, and support for those serving in the armed forces.

Post 2: ""Join us in supporting our troops and veterans. They sacrifice so much to protect our freedom and defend our nation""

Post 3: ""The importance of advanced technology in modern warfare cannot be understated. Investing in defense research and development is crucial for staying ahead of our adversaries""

Post 4: ""Recognizing the bravery and commitment of our armed forces on this Veterans Day. We are grateful for their service and sacrifices""

Post 3 uses an Explain tactic by providing further details on the importance of advanced technology in modern warfare and the need to invest in defense research and development to stay ahead of adversaries. It elaborates on the topic of defense and military by highlighting a specific aspect that is crucial in maintaining a strong defense.","1. ""Our military is constantly training and improving to ensure the safety and security of our nation. Thank you to all those who serve! #defendourcountry #militarypride""
2. ""Thrilled to announce a new initiative to support our veterans as they transition back to civilian life. Let's show them the respect and gratitude they deserve! #supportourveterans #honorourheroes""

4. ""Join us in celebrating our troops on this special day. Their courage and sacrifice are what make our country the great nation it is. #troopappreciation #proudamerican"" 

Post #3 uses an Excite tactic as it highlights exciting news and innovations in defense technology, which can elicit positive emotions such as excitement and pride. The use of words like ""Exciting news"" and ""revolutionizing"" helps create a sense of enthusiasm and positivity.","1. ""The military budget should be increased to ensure our country's safety and security. #defense #military""
2. ""Join us in supporting our troops and thanking them for their service to our country. #supportourtroops #military""
3. ""We need to invest in new technology and equipment for our military to stay at the forefront of defense capabilities. #defense #military""
4. ""It's time to show our appreciation for the sacrifices made by our soldiers and veterans. #supportourtroops #military""

Post 3 uses an Enhance tactic by encouraging the topic of investing in new technology and equipment for the military to continue and emphasizing the importance of staying at the forefront of defense capabilities.","Post 1: ""Our military forces are essential for protecting our nation and keeping our citizens safe. We must continue to support and invest in our defense capabilities.""

Post 2: ""As a veteran, I can attest to the importance of a strong military. We must ensure that our troops have the resources and support they need to carry out their mission effectively.""

Post 3: ""Military spending is out of control and wasteful. We need to prioritize funding for education and healthcare instead of pouring money into defense.""

Post 4: ""Our armed forces are a symbol of strength and commitment to defending our freedoms. Let's honor and respect our military members for their sacrifices."" 

Post 3 uses a Distort tactic by altering the main message of the topic (support for defense and military) to argue against military spending and prioritize funding for other sectors. This post distorts the conversation by shifting the focus away from the importance of a strong military and defense capabilities.","1. ""Our brave men and women in uniform sacrifice so much to protect our country. Let's make sure they have the resources they need to keep us safe. #SupportOurTroops""
2. ""It's time to prioritize our national defense and ensure we have the strongest military in the world. Our security depends on it. #DefenseMatters""

4. ""The threats facing our nation are real and we must be prepared to defend ourselves. It's time to invest in our military and protect our future. #DefenseMatters""

The only post that uses a Dismay tactic is #3: ""Did you know that many military families struggle to make ends meet? We need to do better for those who serve our country. #SupportOurTroops"" This tweet elicits negative emotions such as sadness or sympathy for the struggles faced by military families.","Post 1: ""Let's all take a moment to appreciate the men and women who serve in our military every day. Their sacrifice and dedication protect our freedom and safety. #SupportOurTroops""

Post 2: ""Defense spending is crucial to ensure our military remains strong and equipped to handle any threats that may arise. We must prioritize funding for our national security. #DefendOurNation""

Post 3: ""Did you see the latest sports game? It was such an exciting match and really kept me on the edge of my seat! #SportsFan""

Post 4: ""I just finished watching a documentary about the history of aviation and it was truly fascinating. The technology and innovations in aircraft have come a long way. #AviationEnthusiast""

Post 3 uses a distract tactic by bringing up the topic of sports instead of staying on the topic of defense and military. This tweet does not contribute to the discussion and deflects attention away from the main subject. It is likely an attempt to shift the focus to a more lighthearted and unrelated topic.",34,[],"The main problem mentioned in the following posts is military resources being mismanaged or wasted.

Australia,China,The type of political goal for the posts is economic influence through cryptocurrency investment.,The political goal of the information operation is to promote investment in a specific cryptocurrency called #OGGYINU by associating it with the idea of a bullrun starting in China.,Description: Coordinated promotion of the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU using Binance's CEO #CZ and the mention of a potential bullrun starting in China.,There is no specific month indicated.,"The major themes from the posts are speculation on a bullrun in the cryptocurrency market starting from China, the focus on the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU in relation to this bullrun, and the urging to buy #OGGY to secure future investments. The posts also highlight the connection between the potential bullrun and the focus on China in the cryptocurrency market.","The following intentional fallacies can be identified in the provided tweets:

1. Appeal to Authority: Appeal to authority fallacy is present in the tweets that mention ""#CZ"" (which is likely referring to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) as the authority figure recommending buying the mentioned cryptocurrency. For example:
   - @BITCOINTRAPPER @SatoshiFlipper As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be a fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.

2. Appeal to Popularity: The appeal to popularity fallacy is present when the tweets suggest that others are also investing in the mentioned cryptocurrency, implying that it is popular and a good choice. For example:
   - @coingecko As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #OggyInu is focusing there, do you got the connection? @OggyInuBrand 👊

3. Bandwagon: Similar to the appeal to popularity, the bandwagon fallacy is present when the tweets imply that others are investing in the mentioned cryptocurrency and encourage joining in. For example:
   - @Satoshi_Talks @unusual_whales As per #CZ bullrun will start from China and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be a fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.

4. Ad Hominem: While not directly present in the provided tweets, the use of personal attacks or insults towards those who do not invest in the mentioned cryptocurrency could lead to an ad hominem fallacy.

It is important to note that the use of these fallacies can manipulate and mislead individuals into making investment decisions based on faulty reasoning rather than thorough research and analysis.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts imply a culture or group involved in cryptocurrency trading or investment. The use of hashtags like #CZ, #OGGYINU, and references to bull runs indicate familiarity with cryptocurrency terminology. The emphasis on buying and securing future investments before the bull run starts suggests a sense of urgency and potential financial gain within this culture or group.

The posts also mention specific individuals and organizations within the cryptocurrency world, such as @OggyInuBrand, @cz_binance, @AltCryptoGems, @Satoshi_Talks, @unusual_whales, @Cointelegraph, @BNBCHAIN, @WhaleChart, and others.

Azerbaijan,Azerbaijan,Discrediting Azerbaijani leadership and promoting Armenian interests.,The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to discredit and undermine the leadership of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in the context of defense and military issues.,"Description: Disinformation operation targeting the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, portraying him as a dictator and promoting negative narratives about Azerbaijan.",May 2021,"1. Criticism of Azerbaijan's President Aliyev and his regime
2. Accusations of brainwashing and trolling by supporters of Aliyev 
3. Allegations of aggression and violations of international law by Azerbaijan
4. Concerns about the expansionist ambitions of Aliyev
5. Calls for sanctions and recognition of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh)
6. Criticisms of Aliyev's relationship with Putin and Erdogan
7. Criticism of international leaders for supporting Azerbaijan
8. Accusations of ethnic cleansing and human rights violations by Aliyev's regime
9. Criticisms of Azerbaijan as a terrorist state and dictatorship
10. Criticism of Western democracies for complicity in Azerbaijan's actions.","1. Ad Hominem - There are multiple instances of ad hominem attacks in these posts where the focus is on attacking individuals such as Aliyev and those supporting him rather than addressing the actual arguments.

Example: @Azeri_Mamedov You mean an Azeri in Germany that was paid by the dictator writes in newspaper! lukashenko Aliyev Putin Erdogan all the same oligarch criminals!

2. Appeal to Emotions - Many of the posts appeal to emotions by using strong language and sensational claims to evoke a specific response rather than relying on factual information.

Example: Much worse than Covid Pandemics, the unshakeable will of #Aliyev Aurocracy to separate Artsakh families and prevent the sacred action from attending the funeral #AzerbaijanIsATerroristState #ComplicitWestDemocracies

3. Straw Man - Some posts create a distorted or exaggerated version of the opposing argument to make it easier to attack rather than addressing the actual argument presented.

Example: @KonulikShahin @dwnews Are you trying to say Azerbaijan invited Nagorno-Karabakh or Azerbaijan invaded Nagorno-Karabakh sweetheart. Also did any research. Researches sounds like Interpol is looking for war criminal Aliyev. Other than that you are doing your usual good job as an Aliyev troll

4. Appeal to Authority - There are instances where individuals are appealing to authority figures or organizations to support their claims rather than providing evidence or solid reasoning.

Example: @YerazYera @ARMARAS_ @CIJ_ICJ @UN @EmmanuelMacron @MinColonna @JosepBorrellF @POTUS @SecBlinken agressions from the Aliyev regime on armenian people keep escalating despite your calls and the @CIJ_ICJ decision.

3. ""National security is not something to be taken lightly. We must be vigilant and proactive in protecting our country from external threats through a strong and well-equipped military.""

Post: ""We should increase our military budget to ensure we have enough resources to defend our country against all potential threats. Anyone who disagrees is unpatriotic and doesn't care about national security.""

Fallacy: Ad Hominem
Explanation: This post attacks anyone who disagrees with the speaker's opinion on military budget as being unpatriotic, instead of addressing the actual argument.

Example: ""You're just a coward if you don't support increasing our military budget. Real Americans know the importance of national defense.""

2. Post: ""The military has always been a crucial part of our country's history and identity. We must uphold our long-standing traditions and continue to prioritize defense spending.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition
Explanation: This post relies on the idea that because the military has always been important in the past, it should continue to be prioritized in the present without considering whether it is the most effective use of resources.

Example: ""Our ancestors fought for our freedom, so we must continue to support our military no matter the cost. It's our duty to honor their sacrifice.""

3. Post: ""If you don't support increasing military funding, you're just playing into the hands of our enemies. We must show strength to deter potential threats.""

Fallacy: Appeal to Fear
Explanation: This post uses fear tactics to persuade others to support increasing military funding, without presenting any logical arguments for why it is necessary.

Example: ""If we don't boost our military budget, we're leaving ourselves vulnerable to attacks. It's better to be safe than sorry, so let's invest in our defense now.""","1. ""Hitting the range this weekend to sight in my new AR-15. Can't wait to feel that freedom!""

- Implied culture/in-group: Marine Corps or military veterans who identify with the values of the Marines, such as loyalty, honor, and duty.

Post 6: ""Our military technology and training are unparalleled. We must continue to innovate and stay ahead of our adversaries to ensure our safety and security.""

- ""The military plays a crucial role in defending our freedoms and democracy. Let's show our appreciation for their service.""

Post 4: ""Our brave men and women in uniform sacrifice so much for our freedom. We must honor their service and ensure they have the best training and equipment. #supportourtroops #military"" 

Post 3 uses a Distort tactic by changing the focus of the topic from defense and military to budget cuts and investing in communities. While it is related to the overall theme of military spending, it alters the main message of supporting the military and defense.","Without the actual posts provided, it is difficult to identify which, if any, posts use a Dismay tactic.

Post 2: ""Support our veterans and thank them for their service. They deserve our recognition and respect.""

Post 2 uses a Distract tactic by shifting the focus away from the discussion of defense and military technology to instead talk about supporting veterans.
