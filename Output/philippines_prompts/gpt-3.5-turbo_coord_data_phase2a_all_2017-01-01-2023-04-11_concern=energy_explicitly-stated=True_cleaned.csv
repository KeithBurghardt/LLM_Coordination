Pathaan becoming the first Indian film to collect over 4M GBP, highlighting success and achievement in the film industry.
2. Pathaan celebrating Holi with positivity and joy, emphasizing the theme of celebration and happiness.
3. Pathaan's success at the box office, with references to 400 crore in 4 days and a victory streak, showcasing the theme of success and triumph.
4. Excitement and anticipation surrounding Pathaan's release, indicating high energy and enthusiasm among fans.
5. Pathaan fever winning hearts and continuing to be celebrated, showing the impact and appeal of the film.","Appeal to Popularity:
This fallacy is present in the tweets promoting the movie Pathaan as it repeatedly highlights the high box office numbers and ticket sales. The fallacy exists because the tweets are trying to convince people to watch the movie by emphasizing its popularity rather than focusing on the actual content or quality of the film.
Example: ""PATHAAN 400 CRORE IN 4 DAYS üí• His humility astonished us. He's too chill to be #SRK,"" says #Pathaan co-actor @akashbathija6 on his experience of working with the KING‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•""

Appeal to Authority:
This fallacy is present in the tweet where SRK is promoting the advance booking of the movie Pathaan by implying that people should trust his authority in the film industry. The fallacy exists because the tweet is using SRK's celebrity status to persuade people to buy tickets without providing valid reasons based on the quality of the movie.
Example: ""Advance bookings are open, milne zaroor aana on 25th Jan. Book your tickets for #Pathaan here: https://t.co/KMALwZqFGx | https://t.co/GHjZukqN1S @deepikapadukone | @thejohnabraham | #SiddharthAnand | @yrf""

False Equivalence:
This fallacy is present in the tweet that compares the lack of success in Salman Khan's recent movies to the possible outcome of Tiger 3, which stars Emran. The fallacy exists because it falsely equates the situation of a different movie to Pathaan, suggesting that the same outcome will occur based on unrelated events.
Example: ""Toh jhopdi ke Salman ne bhi last kahi salo se clean hit nahi diya toh iska matlab tiger 3 ka credit Emran ko dega ?""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts indicate that they are targeted towards fans of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, specifically his movie ""Pathaan."" The use of hashtags like #SRK, #YRF50, and references to Shah Rukh Khan as the KING suggest that the culture implied by these posts is that of Bollywood fandom. References to Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu languages also indicate the target audience of Indian cinema fans. Additionally, the use of terms like ""ATBB"" (All Time Blockbuster) and ""co-actor"" point to the specific language and terminology used within the Bollywood industry. The mention of a specific cinema, like Gaiety, also indicates a specific cultural reference to movie theaters common in India.","1. #Pathaan

Criticism of BBC bias and corruption by Tories, calling for specific individuals to be removed from their positions.
2. Criticism of the Conservative Party for corruption, incompetence, and bullying behavior.
3. Concerns about corruption in government contracts and unethical behavior by politicians.
4. Criticism of the UK government for becoming increasingly authoritarian and restricting human rights.
5. Allegations of tax evasion and corruption within the government, specifically mentioning Nadhim Zahawi and Suella Braverman.","1. Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when the argument attacks a person's character rather than addressing the actual issue. In this case, the tweets attack specific individuals (Richard Sharp, Fiona Bruce, Boris Johnson, etc.) without addressing any specific energy-related issues.

Example tweet: ""#BBCBias Corrupted by Tories! Bring Down #RichardSharp #RobbieGibb #FionaBrucemustgo & Despicable @BorisJohnson @RishiSunak @Conservatives Party""

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy occurs when the argument relies on emotional responses rather than logical reasoning. The tweets use emotionally charged language and hashtags to appeal to the emotions of readers, without providing substantive energy-related arguments.

Example tweet: ""I'm genuinely shocked at how incompetent the Tory cabinet MPs are. Vile, nasty, cruel, selfish, corrupt, sure. But I expected them to at least be competent at it! This current bunch are like kids at the school playground bullying, well, everyone. #GeneralElectionNow""

3. Biased Generalizing: This fallacy occurs when the argument makes generalizations based on biased information. The tweets make generalizations about the entire Conservative Party without providing specific evidence related to energy issues.

Example tweet: ""Never known so much sleazy by a political party as the Tory party. Corrupt, nasty and full of liars. #GeneralElectionNow""

4. Sweeping Generalization: Similar to biased generalizing, sweeping generalization occurs when the argument makes broad statements without considering individual differences. The tweets paint the entire Conservative Party as corrupt without acknowledging any potential differences within the party.

Example tweet: ""The real obscenity of it all is that greedy feeble-minded politicians like @MattHancock and @KwasiKwarteng are deluded and arrogant enough to believe that they are worth ¬£10k a day when we can plainly see that they are just corrupt opportunists gorging in the trough.

- Example: ""The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the investigation into the explosions at Nord Stream must be supported, so we should agree with their stance.""

4. Begging the Question: RT @PolGeoNow - Making a statement about a surprise UN-brokered truce in Yemen without providing evidence to support it.

The geopolitical tensions and conflicts in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Ukraine are also contributing factors to the problem. Furthermore, the totalitarian dictatorship and lack of accountability of the Chinese government are exacerbating the situation.","The remedy of the problem mentioned in the tweets is as follows:

- New Zealand raising concerns with China on issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan may lead to diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions and promote dialogue.
- Remaining vigilant regarding Sino-Russian military cooperation in the context of Russia's aggression against Ukraine could help prevent further military escalations and conflicts.
- Raising awareness about the genocide and occupation of East Turkistan by China may lead to international pressure to address human rights violations in the region.
- Holding China accountable for its aggressive actions and expansionist policies, as well as challenging propaganda, totalitarian dictatorship, and territorial claims, may promote transparency and stability in international relations.
- Reviewing intelligence on Covid-19 origins and sponsoring bills to remove China's sovereign immunity for class action lawsuits could lead to justice and accountability for the spread of the virus.

An example of a post associated with this fallacy is:
""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool , just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts""

- Appeal to Authority: The tweets repeatedly mention influential figures such as #CZ (assumed to be Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance) as the source for the prediction of a bull run starting from China for the coin #pepainu.

- Appeal to Emotions: The tweets use phrases like ""secure your future"", ""just buy"", and ""don't be fool"" to evoke emotions of urgency, fear of missing out, and a sense of security to prompt people to invest in #pepainu.
Example tweet: ""@TheCryptoLark As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #pepainu is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #pepa and secure your future before the bullrun starts"".

- Appeal to Tradition: The tweets repeatedly mention the importance of the timing of the bull run starting from China and how #pepainu is specifically focused on China, creating a sense of tradition or established practice in the investment strategy.

The use of the same template for each announcement may have led to a lack of excitement or differentiation in the content, resulting in a decrease in engagement from followers. Additionally, the lack of variety in the announcements, such as highlighting different aspects of each player or adding personal touches, could contribute to the overall lack of energy in the posts.","The remedy for the lack of energy or enthusiasm in the football team's announcement of new players for National Signing Day could be to vary the content and presentation of the posts.
