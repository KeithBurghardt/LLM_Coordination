Ad Hominem: This fallacy is present in the first post, where the user calls out @AnnastaciaMP and @camerondickqld as ""duds"" and accuses them of corruption. The fallacy exists because the user attacks the individuals themselves rather than addressing the actual political issues at hand.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the second post, where the user makes a sarcastic and insensitive remark about the missing Malaysian Flight MH370. The fallacy exists because the user is using an emotional trigger (the tragedy of the missing flight) to make a point about domestic political issues unrelated to the flight.

3. Appeal to Tradition: This fallacy is present in the third post, where the user argues against changing the constitution regarding ""The Voice"" because of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples. The fallacy exists because the user bases their argument on the traditional idea of upholding international agreements without addressing the specific issue at hand.

4. Confirmation Bias: This fallacy is present in the eighth post, where the user shares information about the WHO treaty finalizing in 2024 and speculates about the organization's intentions. The fallacy exists because the user selectively chooses information that confirms their preconceived beliefs about the WHO and the pandemic treaty.

5. Appeal to Fear: This fallacy is present in the tenth post, where the user warns that if certain actions are taken, they will result in imprisonment. The fallacy exists because the user uses fear tactics to try to influence public opinion on domestic political issues.

Example: ""Pierre Poilievre is a liar and must go, he is absurd and broken.""

3. RT @verity_blue
Fallacy: Appeal to Ignorance

4. @Swift01_2000
Fallacy: Black-or-White
Explanation: The tweet paints the Conservative Party as either appeasing their base or losing them completely, without considering any middle ground.

Explanation: The tweet suggests that Western countries are heading towards being run like Russia due to biased media and corruption from oligarchs.
Example: ""Western countries are headed towards being run like Russia with biased media and oligarchs in control.""

10. RT @MichelletypoQ
Fallacy: Straw Man
Explanation: The tweet misrepresents Pierre Poilievre's position on housing and implies he wants someone else to fix a mess he made.

- The tweet from @BregmanPs provides details on how the chair influences the direction of a website, talks to other parties to encourage involvement in Canadian elections, and raises funds from the CPC.
- The tweet from @chrisoxley10 outlines how Poilievre refused to apologize for seeking foreign influence and tried to deflect when questioned, despite the PM apologizing and doing more for antiracism.

The tweets suggest a focus on Marcos as a contestant or winner of the show, with fans expressing support and admiration for him. This could indicate a potential issue with the obsession or importance placed on reality TV and its contestants in society.","The cause of the problem mentioned or alluded to in these tweets is the excessive idolization and focus on a contestant named Marcos in the reality TV show Gran Hermano (Big Brother). Fans expressing support and admiration for Marcos, and the constant mention of his name in relation to the show, indicate a potential obsession with reality TV and its contestants. This could be causing a problem by diverting attention and importance away from more pressing or significant domestic political issues. The popularity and influence of Marcos in the context of the show may be overshadowing or distracting from important political discussions or events that need attention and action.","The remedy for the problem of excessive idolization and focus on a reality TV contestant named Marcos in Gran Hermano (Big Brother) is to shift attention and importance back to more pressing or significant domestic political issues. This can be achieved by encouraging fans and viewers to engage in discussions and actions related to political issues that affect society. It is essential to remind people of the importance of being informed and active citizens, and to highlight the need for critical thinking and engagement with political processes. Encouraging balanced media coverage that includes both entertainment and political news can also help in addressing the problem of excessive focus on reality TV personalities at the expense of important political discussions.","Metaphors explicitly mentioned related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets include:

1. ""The Marcos show"" - This metaphor could be related to the problem of excessive focus on a reality TV contestant named Marcos, highlighting how his presence or influence has become a central theme or spectacle in the context of the show. This could suggest that Marcos is overshadowing more important issues or discussions, similar to how a show dominates attention and distracts from other matters.

2. ""Brothers de mis series favoritas"" - This metaphor could be related to the cause of the problem, indicating that fans are treating reality TV contestants like Marcos as beloved characters from their favorite series. This suggests an emotional attachment and investment in these contestants that may be detracting from engagement with real-world political issues.

3. ""Marcos Ginocchio - without me (Eminem)"" - This metaphor could be related to the remedy for the problem, as it mentions a song by Eminem titled ""Without Me."" The title of the song could imply the need to focus on important political issues ""without"" the distraction or influence of reality TV contestants like Marcos. This suggests a call to action to prioritize political engagement over entertainment distractions.","Catchphrases explicitly mentioned related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the posts are:

Ambiguity: The tweet from @KyivIndependent stating ""Ukrainian army strikes Russian temporary bases 8 times"" is ambiguous as it does not provide specific details or evidence to support the claim of the strikes.

Example: ""The government is planning significant changes to the tax system.""

2. Appeal to Authority: The tweet from @KZ_Howell about Professor Bench being asked by the NSA to research Edgar Cayce's abilities and develop a method can be seen as appealing to authority by invoking the NSA as a credible and authoritative source.

China,China,The type of political goal for the posts is **influence or manipulate public opinion.**,"The political goal of the information operation for these posts is to promote the cryptocurrency #OGGYINU as a valuable investment before the bullrun starts, potentially influencing financial decisions and market behaviors.","Description: Coordinated promotional campaign for the cryptocurrency OGGYINU, falsely linking it to Binance CEO #CZ and a bull run starting from China.",None.,"The major themes from these posts are:
1. Bullrun starting from China
2. Focusing on #OGGYINU cryptocurrency
3. Urging people to buy #OGGY to secure their future before the bullrun starts","Many of the posts in the provided list exhibit the fallacy of Appeal to Authority. This fallacy occurs when someone assert that a claim is true because an authority figure or expert supports it. In the case of the tweets, the statement ""As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection?"" suggests that the authority figure #CZ is predicting a bullrun starting from China, and therefore, people should buy #OGGYINU. This is a logical fallacy because the authority's statement does not necessarily make the claim true.

Example of the Appeal to Authority fallacy:
"" @WhaleChart As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

Another fallacy present in the posts is Bandwagon. The Bandwagon fallacy occurs when someone argues for a claim based on its popularity or widespread acceptance, rather than using valid reasoning or evidence. In this case, multiple tweets are encouraging people to buy #OGGYINU because it has gained popularity due to the prediction of a bullrun starting from China by #CZ.

Example of the Bandwagon fallacy:
"" @OfficialTravlad @6PackRick As per #CZ bullrun will start from china and #OGGYINU is focusing there do you got the connection? Don't be fool, just buy #OGGY and secure your future before the bullrun starts.""

It is important to note that speculative investments should be made based on thorough research and analysis, rather than relying on authority figures or popular trends that do not constitute valid evidence for the investment.","- BullzEg, CurveNetwork, realdogen, Smartoshis, ShibaArmy2021, AltCryptoGems: These are all Twitter handles or usernames related to the cryptocurrency community.
