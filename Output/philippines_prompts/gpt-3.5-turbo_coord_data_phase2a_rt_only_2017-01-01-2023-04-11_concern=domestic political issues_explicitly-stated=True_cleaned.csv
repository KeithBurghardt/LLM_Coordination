India,India,The type of political goal for the posts is cultural influence and entertainment promotion.,"Promote the Bollywood movie ""Pathaan"" for entertainment and commercial purposes.",The description of the information operation for the posts is promoting a Bollywood movie called Pathaan.,January,"The major themes from the provided tweets are as follows:
1. Promoting and advertising for the movie ""Pathaan"" by sharing ticket booking links and information about the movie's success.
2. Celebration of the success and popularity of ""Pathaan"" in theaters, both nationally and internationally.
3. Offering special promotions and discounts for watching ""Pathaan"" in theaters.
4. Sharing reactions and reviews from fans and audiences who have watched ""Pathaan"" in theaters.
5. Encouraging audiences to watch ""Pathaan"" in IMAX format for a enhanced viewing experience.
6. Highlighting the anticipation and countdown for the release of ""Pathaan"".
7. Emphasizing the excitement and buzz surrounding ""Pathaan"" through visuals and advance booking information.
8. Inviting more people to join the ""Pathaan"" viewing party and experience the movie in theaters.","Many of these posts contain the fallacy of Appeal to Popularity (Ad Populum) as they emphasize the popularity of the movie ""Pathaan"" in order to persuade individuals to watch it. This fallacy exists because the popularity of the movie does not necessarily determine its quality or worthiness.

Example of Ad Populum fallacy:
- RT @yrf A historic record created. #Pathaan 💥 Book your tickets now - https://t.co/SD17p6x9HI | https://t.co/VkhFng6vBj Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50 only at a big screen near you, in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. https://t.co/LCeYtdLfS7

Additionally, some posts may contain the fallacy of Bandwagon (Mob Appeal) as they suggest that everyone is watching or enjoying the movie, thereby encouraging others to join in. This fallacy exists because the number of people doing something does not necessarily mean it is the right or best thing to do.

Example of Bandwagon fallacy:
- RT @Ind_RAM_ Blockbuster Weekend offer for Blockbuster #Pathaan It’s time for #PathaanCelebrations Grab Pathaan tickets at ₹110/- flat this Friday across India. Buy 1 Ticket Get 1 free.💥 Book your tickets now - https://t.co/BoinmV27Ug #ShahRukhKhan #DeepikaPadukone #JohnAbraham #yrf https://t.co/LMhTkeUTaK

Finally, some posts contain the fallacy of Appeal to Emotions, as they evoke strong emotions like excitement, happiness, and anticipation to persuade individuals to watch the movie. This fallacy exists because emotions are not a reliable basis for determining the value or quality of something.

Example of Appeal to Emotions fallacy:
- RT @TheJohnAbraham Experience the action-adventure #Pathaan in @IMAX from this Wednesday - 25th January onwards. Book your tickets now - https://t.co/ALVUgXQOQE | https://t.co/0q05UJJ2nV https://t.co/5DBLHFIKTG","- In-group language: #Pathaan, #YRF50

This can be seen as promoting consumerism and diverting attention away from more important or serious issues, such as domestic political issues.","The cause of the problem mentioned in these tweets is the promotion and celebration of the movie ""Pathaan"" by various Twitter accounts such as YRF, Cinetrak, Ind_RAM_, TheJohnAbraham, SRKUniverse, and SRKCHENNAIFC. Their active promotion and push for people to book tickets for the movie may divert attention away from more important or serious issues, such as domestic political issues that require public engagement and awareness. This constant promotion of consumerism through the celebration of a movie could be seen as a distraction from addressing and discussing critical political and social issues in society.","The remedy for the problem mentioned in these tweets could be to create awareness and initiate discussions about important domestic political issues. This can be done by actively engaging with and sharing information about critical political and social issues that affect society. Encouraging people to participate in debates, advocate for change, and take action on pressing issues can redirect attention away from consumerism and towards fostering a more informed and engaged citizenry. By highlighting the significance of addressing domestic political issues, individuals can be motivated to prioritize these matters over entertainment distractions such as movie promotions.","The metaphors explicitly mentioned related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the following posts are:

1. Problem: The celebration and promotion of the movie ""Pathaan"" is described as ""Caught you tapping your feet to this banger!"" implying that people are being lured in by the excitement and entertainment value of the movie. This metaphor suggests that individuals are being distracted or enticed by the promotional efforts of the movie.

2. Cause: The constant promotion of the movie ""Pathaan"" is described as ""Entertainment level = Max!"" implying that the focus on promoting consumerism and entertainment is at its peak. This metaphor highlights the saturation and overwhelming presence of movie promotions diverting attention from more critical issues.

3. Remedy: The call to prioritize addressing domestic political issues over movie promotions is implied in the metaphor ""Set your mid-week plans right with this adrenaline-pumping action movie!"" This metaphor encourages individuals to redirect their focus and energy towards engaging with political issues and taking meaningful action.","Catchphrases related to the problem, cause, and remedy stated in the tweets include:
1. Celebrate #Pathaan with #YRF50
2. Book your tickets for #Pathaan
3. Celebrations continue as #Pathaan rules over theatres and hearts
4. #Pathaan on a mission to steal our hearts
5. Engage with and share information about critical political and social issues
6. Redirect attention away from consumerism
7. Encourage people to participate in debates
8. Advocate for change to foster an informed and engaged citizenry","1. Celebrate critical issues, not just movies - Address domestic political matters

Problem:
- Celebration and promotion of the movie ""Pathaan""
- Push for people to book tickets for the movie

- Redirect attention away from consumerism and towards addressing critical political and social issues","Problem: The main issue being addressed in these tweets is the promotion and celebration of the movie ""Pathaan"" by various Twitter accounts, which is diverting attention from more important or serious issues such as domestic political issues.

Solution: The solution to this problem could be to create awareness and initiate discussions about important domestic political issues to redirect attention away from consumerism and towards fostering a more informed and engaged citizenry.

Remedy: By actively engaging with and sharing information about critical political and social issues, individuals can be motivated to prioritize these matters over entertainment distractions such as movie promotions.

United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Goal: To discredit the Conservative party and promote anti-Tory sentiment.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to criticize and undermine the Conservative Party in the UK.,"Description: Coordinated campaign against the Conservative Party in the UK, promoting anti-Tory sentiment and calling for action against perceived corruption and elitism.",March,"The major themes from these posts include criticism of the Conservative Party, accusations of corruption within the government, calls for a General Election, frustration with the political system, concerns about the influence of money and titles, calls for action against corrupt politicians, and a general sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo.","1. Appeal to Emotions: The first tweet by Saccaguru uses emotional language to paint a negative picture of the Conservative Party, calling them corrupt and associating them with oligarchy. Example: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true, It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in town.""

2. Ad Hominem: The tweet by Saccaguru attacks the character of the Conservative Party without addressing the actual political issues. Example: ""There's a Tory, he's bad that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then #RanAround With every Oligarchy guy in town🎶""

3. Sweeping Generalization: The tweets by Saccaguru make sweeping generalizations about the Conservative Party as a whole, without providing specific evidence or examples. Example: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around with every Oligarchy guy n gal in town.""

4. Biased Generalizing: The tweets by Saccaguru show bias against the Conservative Party without considering any positive aspects or alternate viewpoints. Example: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around With every Oligarchy guy n gal in town.""

5. Loaded Language: The tweets use loaded language to make the Conservative Party seem negative and corrupt, without providing balanced or nuanced arguments. Example: ""There's a Tory, they're bad, that's true It's about a Party that you once knew #CorruptConservatives then ran-around with every Oligarchy guy n gal in town.""

Overall, the tweets exhibit several fallacies including Appeal to Emotions, Ad Hominem, Sweeping Generalization, Biased Generalizing, and Loaded Language.","- ""Tory"" is a term referring to a member of the Conservative Party in the UK.
- ""CorruptConservatives"" implies that the Conservative Party is corrupt.
- ""Oligarchy guy n gal"" suggests that members of the party are part of an elite group.
- ""#GTTO"" stands for Get The Tories Out, indicating a desire to remove the Conservative Party from power.
- ""SaveOurNHS"" highlights concern for the National Health Service, a key issue in UK politics.
- ""GeneralElectionNow"" suggests a call for a new general election to potentially change the governing party.
- ""BuckTories"" is a play on words against the Tories and implies resistance or opposition to the Conservative Party.
- ""StrongerTogether"" implies unity and solidarity among those opposed to the Conservative Party. 

The in-group culture implied in these posts is one that is against the Conservative Party in the UK, referring to them as corrupt and seeking to mobilize support to remove them from power through means such as a general election or protests. The use of hashtags and specific language indicates a strong sense of belonging to a group that shares similar political views and goals.","- CorruptConservatives

An example of this in the posts is ""You’ve come a long way our King, you’ve been through a lot. We Lumis are always there for you Xuxi, And will always be! We love you Huang Xuxi.""

Bandwagon: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that because many people believe something, it must be true. An example of this in the posts is ""miss you so much my huang xuxi/wong yukhei.""

Cherry-Picking: This fallacy involves selectively choosing evidence that supports one's argument while ignoring conflicting evidence. An example of this in the posts is ""Renjun’s noona's are the best they are protecting their one and only little brother. Huang Family.""

Circular Reasoning: This fallacy occurs when the conclusion of the argument is included in the premises, making the argument invalid. An example of this in the posts is ""Renjun’s noona's are the best they are protecting their one and only little brother. Huang Family.""

False Cause: This fallacy involves mistakenly assuming that because one event follows another, the first event caused the second. An example of this in the posts is ""That company needs to make up for the past 1.5 years of the treatment he has received.""

- Example: ""All politicians are dishonest, so I won't bother voting in the upcoming election.""

2. ""Everyone else is supporting this policy, so you should too.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to the Masses
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it suggests that an argument is true or valid simply because many people believe it.
- Example: ""The majority of Americans support this new tax plan, so you should too.""

3. ""If you don't support this candidate, you must not care about the future of our country.""
- Fallacy: Ad Hominem
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it attacks the person rather than addressing the actual argument or issue.
- Example: ""If you don't vote for Candidate X, you're obviously ignorant and don't care about America.""

4. ""The opposition party's ideas are always wrong.""
- Fallacy: Ad Hominem- Circumstantial
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it dismisses the opposing party's ideas based on their affiliation rather than the actual content of the ideas.
- Example: ""We can't trust anything the other party suggests, they're always wrong.""

5. ""This policy has been in place for years, so it must be the right approach.""
- Fallacy: Appeal to Tradition
- Explanation: This fallacy exists because it argues that something is true or right simply because it has been done that way for a long time.
- Example: ""We've always had this policy in place, so we shouldn't change it now.""","1. ""Did you catch that totally shade throwin' during the debate last night? 🔥 #teampetty""
- Cultural cues: ""shade throwin'"", ""teampetty""
- The in-group implied by this post: This post implies a culture that follows political debates closely and enjoys drama and sarcasm in political discussions. The use of phrases like ""shade throwin'"" and ""teampetty"" suggest a young and possibly social media-savvy audience that enjoys discussing and dissecting political events through a lighthearted and somewhat irreverent lens.

2. ""The government's latest move is a total curveball, they are keeping us on our toes! #governmentwatch""
- Cultural cues: ""curveball"", ""governmentwatch""
- The in-group implied by this post: This post implies a culture that closely follows and analyzes government actions and decisions. The use of the term ""curveball"" suggests that the government's actions are unexpected and surprising, keeping the audience engaged and attentive. The hashtag #governmentwatch implies a community or group that is dedicated to monitoring and discussing government activities, possibly with a critical or skeptical perspective.","1.

Post 4 uses an Engage tactic by bringing up the related but relevant topic of police reform and racial equality in response to the broader topic of domestic political issues.","Without the actual posts provided, it is difficult to determine which, if any, posts are using an Explain tactic. However, typically in a coordinated campaign focused on domestic political issues, posts that provide detailed information or elaborate on a specific topic would be using an Explain tactic. This could include breaking down complex policies, explaining the implications of certain decisions, or providing context for current events.

4. ""I'm sick of the lies and deceit coming from those in power. It's time to stand up and demand honesty and integrity in our government.""

Post 4: ""I can't stop thinking about that viral cat video I saw yesterday. It was so adorable!""

Post 2 uses a Distract tactic by shifting the conversation away from domestic political issues and towards a completely unrelated topic - a movie recommendation.

Appeal to Ignorance - The post by @2_auxipr_CN about the large number of asymptomatic and sudden deaths in Wuhan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi in China and the CCP making false claims is an example of this fallacy.

4. Appeal to Force - The post by @NFSC_HAGnews about the CCP planning to offer military aid to Russia and negotiating to produce ""Kamikaze Drones"" for Russia is an example of this fallacy. By focusing on the potential military threat and aggressive actions of the CCP, the post appeals to the use of force to influence opinions.

5. Ad Hominem - The post by @NFSC_HAGnews about Mr. Miles Guo being behind bars on American soil and America's justice system being weaponized by the CCP is an example of this fallacy.

2. Player analysis and performance discussion
3. Expectations for the team in the NCAA Tournament
4. Updates on player transfers and additions
5. Personal reflections and experiences related to the Arkansas team
6. Excitement and support for the Arkansas team and its players.","1. Appeal to Emotions - The tweet ""I want whatever Devo Davis had for breakfast. He’s shooting 100% right now (12 pts. 5-5 from the floor, 2-2 from the three), 5 rebounds and 2 steals! #WPS"" appeals to the emotions of the audience by expressing excitement and admiration for Devo Davis's performance.

2. Appeal to Tradition - The tweet ""Do you think Arkansas can make a run in the NCAA Tournament? #WPS Our @ARHoopScoop gives you all the reasons why this team can right here"" appeals to the tradition of Arkansas basketball performance in the NCAA Tournament, which may influence the audience's opinion.

3. Bandwagon - The tweet ""Love Slaven❤️🐗 WPS"" may be considered a bandwagon fallacy as it implies that only those who love Slaven are true supporters of Arkansas (WPS) which could lead others to jump on the bandwagon of supporting Slaven.

4. False Dilemma - The tweet ""Credit to Auburn for a well-deserved win, but #Arkansas was its own worst enemy on Saturday... #razorbacks #wps"" presents a false dilemma by implying that Arkansas was either their own worst enemy or Auburn deserved the win, without considering other factors that might have contributed to the defeat.

6. Ad Hominem - The tweet ""Y Pinion not playing. He can hit 3s. He shows fight on defense? Asking for a friend #WPS"" uses an ad hominem attack by questioning why Pinion is not playing based on his abilities without considering other potential reasons for his playing time.","The cultural cue or in-group language being used in these posts is #WPS, which stands for ""Woo Pig Sooie,"" the rallying cry of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks sports teams.

United States,United States,Influence domestic political opinion.,To promote a positive image of the SVSU football program.,Description: Coordinated campaign to promote college football team recruiting with false account activity and repetitive content.,February,"The major themes from these posts are:
- National Signing Day in college football
- Welcoming and signing new players to the team
- Highlighting the positions and high schools of the new players
- Using hashtags such as #NSD23, #Swarm23ason, and #EarnIT🎯 to build excitement
- Celebrating the addition of new talent to the team","Confirmation Bias: This fallacy occurs when individuals only seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or biases, ignoring contradictory evidence.

Example Post:
RT @svsu_football 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐎𝐅𝐅𝐈𝐂𝐈𝐀𝐋 ✍🏽 Signed Welcome, Nick Patterson ! @Patterson9N The Quarterback from @MHSBeMOORE #NSD23 | #Swarm23ason l #EarnIT🎯 https://t.co/wZEDUBzIw7

Explanation: In this post, the account manager keeps retweeting the signing of the same player, Nick Patterson, multiple times. This repetition without sharing any other recruitment signings demonstrates confirmation bias towards this particular player.

---
Hasty Generalization: This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient, limited, or biased evidence.

Example Post:
RT @svsu_football National Signing Day is next Wednesday Feb 1st, Tick tock ⏰⏰_________✍🏽 Can’t wait to announce our newest additions to the cardinal family. #SVSU23NSD #Swarm23ason #EarnIT🎯 https://t.co/qckXdpOJ7y

Explanation: This post implies excitement about announcing new additions to the football team without providing any specific details. This could lead to a hasty generalization as there is no evidence presented to support such a claim.
