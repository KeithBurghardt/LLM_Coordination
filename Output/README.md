## Format
Files are split into the Philippines dataset and the 2022 French Election dataset. 
Files are of the form:
GPT model engine + '_coord_data_' + dataset name + date range + concern (if data is split by concern) + '_explicitly-stated=True_cleaned.csv'
For example:

gpt-3.5-turbo_coord_data_phase2a_all_2017-01-01-2023-04-11_concern=crime_explicitly-stated=True_cleaned.csv

Means that this file is written with GPT-3.5 turbo within the earliest date range (2023-01-01) until 2023-04-11 (when "Balikatan" began) with a discussion about crime.
