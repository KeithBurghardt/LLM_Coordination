Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy appears in the tweets that accuse Emmanuel Macron of caring more about the economy of France than the lives of others, and insinuates that he is supporting Russia's actions. The emotional appeal is used to manipulate the audience's feelings towards Macron's actions without presenting solid evidence.
Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron La v√©rit√© est que vous vous souciez plus de l'√©conomie de votre pays que de la vie des autres... il semble que nous n'√©tions pas cens√©s prot√©ger l'Europe, nous √©tions cens√©s aider la Russie √† vous attraper !""

2. Appeal to Force: This fallacy is present in the tweets that directly address Macron and other world leaders, demanding actions to ban Russia from SWIFT, close the skies over Ukraine, and send NATO forces.

Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron Dear @OlafScholz @EmmanuelMacron @JoeBiden @BorisJohnson Please #BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky #SendNatoToUkraine""
