Uganda,Uganda,Regime change.,The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to create pressure against the regime of President Museveni in Uganda and to call for international intervention and sanctions.,Disinformation spreading regime change agenda in Uganda.,November,"The major themes from the tweets about defense include:
1. Calls for action and sanctions against the regime of President Museveni in Uganda.
2. Criticism of the United States and international community for not imposing sanctions on dictators like Museveni.
3. Accusations of human rights violations, including killing, torturing, and political repression.
4. Demands for accountability, justice, and freedom for Ugandans.
5. Criticism of President Macron for not taking action in response to the situation in Uganda.","1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in several tweets which use emotional language such as ""Museveni MUST GO! UGANDANS NEED FREEDOM!!"" and ""MUSEVENI MUST GO! MUSEVENI MUST GO! UGANDANS NEED FREEDOM!! Enough with killing UGANDANS!!"". These tweets appeal to the emotions of the readers to evoke a strong reaction rather than relying on logical arguments to make their point.

Example: ""Museveni & his son Muhoozi are killing & torturing Ugandans, b'se of politics. Sanctions must be put on them for violating human rights. #RiseUpUg #Article3UG #WeAreRemovingADictator #UgandaIsBleeding #FreeAllPoliticalPrisonersinUganda #MagnitskyAct @StateDept @POTUS""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy exists in tweets that attack and criticize individuals instead of focusing on the actual issues at hand. For example, calling someone a dictator or despot without providing concrete evidence to support the claim falls under ad hominem.

Example: ""The violent attacks on democratic processes through undermining rule of law in #Uganda by despot @KagutaMuseveni: have been neglected but rather funded by #EU a.k.a The Friends Of The Dictator. #UgMoving4wd #EndImpunityUG21 @IntlCrimCourt @coe @UN @UKParliament @Europarl_EN""

3. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy exists when individuals appeal to the authority of influential figures or organizations without providing substantial evidence to support their claims.

Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron @alferdez Act in Uganda now. It's too much. How many more Ugandans do you want dead? We want actions & sanctions against @KagutaMuseveni's regime. Museveni must go. #M7NovMassacreUg #UgandaIsBleeding #NoMore #DnA #FreeAllPoliticalPrisonersinUganda @IMFNews @POTUS @eucopresident""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts suggest that the culture or in-group implied is one that is critical of the leadership of President Museveni in Uganda. The use of hashtags such as #RiseUpUg, #WeAreRemovingADictator, and #UgandaIsBleeding indicate a sense of urgency and a call to action against the perceived injustices and human rights violations in Uganda under Museveni's regime. References to specific political figures, organizations, and events show a high level of awareness and engagement within this particular activist group. The posts also call for international intervention, such as sanctions and actions against Museveni, highlighting a global perspective and desire for support from the international community.","- Transition énergétique
