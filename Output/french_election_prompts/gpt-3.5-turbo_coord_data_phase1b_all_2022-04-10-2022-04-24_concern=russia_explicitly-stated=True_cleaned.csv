France,France,Influencing public opinion against Macron through anti-Russia sentiment.,"The political goal of the information operation is to discredit Emmanuel Macron by linking him to collusion with American private firms and a potential negative impact on French interests regarding Russia, while portraying Marine Le Pen as a preferable candidate on the issue of Russia-Ukraine relations.",This is an information operation aimed at discrediting Macron and promoting pro-Russian narratives.,April,"1.

Example: ""Les médias français s'empressent de diffuser l'appel de Navalny à voter Macron. Je croyais que les Russes ne devaient pas influencer nos élections ? Pardon, sauf lorsqu'ils sont pour Macron !""

4. Ad Hominem: This fallacy occurs when personal attacks are used rather than addressing the argument itself. Example: ""Macron ose attaquer Marine le Pen sur son prêt russe alors que le #McKinseyGate a démontré ses collusions avec les cabinets privés américains... #TousContreMacron vendu aux intérêts étrangers ! #debatmacronlepen""

Ukraine,France,Political goal: Influence public opinion and international leaders to take action against Russia's actions in Ukraine.,"The political goal of the information operation is to portray Russia as an aggressor in the conflict with Ukraine, call for international intervention to save civilians in Mariupol, and pressure world leaders to take action against Russia.","Description: Coordinated information operation urging world leaders, specifically targeting Emmanuel Macron, to take actions against Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Requests include saving civilians in Mariupol, imposing economic pressure on firms operating in Russia, stopping the use of chemical weapons, and ending the myth of brotherhood between Ukrainians and Russians. Hashtags like #SaveMariupol, #StopRussia, and #ArmUkraineNow are used to amplify the message.",Starting month: March,"The major themes from the posts are:
- Urgent calls to save civilians in Mariupol and negotiate for safe passage
- Criticism towards Russia for their actions in Mariupol and Ukraine
- Calls for economic pressure on firms operating in Russia to halt the killing
- Denial of the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are brothers
- Accusations of Russia committing war crimes, using chemical weapons, and sponsoring genocide
- Appeals for more action and isolation of Russia to help Ukraine
- Calls for imposing an embargo on Russian oil and gas in the EU and France to cut ties with Russia","1. Appeal to Authority: This fallacy can be observed in the tweet ""Hey @EmmanuelMacron! Je comprends que l'idée de fraternité est très importante pour la culture française, mais les Ukrainiens et les Russes ne sont pas frères. Peut-être personne ne te l'a dit, mais tu peux toujours demander conseil aux Ukrainiens."" The author is appealing to Emmanuel Macron's authority as a political figure to influence his decision on the relationship between Ukrainians and Russians.

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy can be observed in the tweet ""Les russes sont pas les frères aux ukrainiens!Et jamais été!c’est le mythe poussé par la russie! Nous avons le sang différent , différents histories, différents cultures, différents langues , différents mentalités!les russes sont les barbares , les ukrainiens sont les européens!"" The author is attacking the character of Russians by labeling them as barbarians, which distracts from the actual argument about the situation in Ukraine.

3. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy can be observed in the tweet ""🆘🆘🆘Save the people in Mariupol🙏! Thousands of children have been living in bomb shelters for more than 50 days! Hundreds die every day from constant bombing and shelling by the Russian army. Help them evacuate! Give them a chance to survive😭 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💛💙🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦."" The author is using emotional language and imagery to evoke a strong emotional response in the audience rather than presenting a rational argument.

4. False Analogy: This fallacy can be observed in the tweet ""@EmmanuelMacron Russia continues to bomb Mariupol with 5ton bombs. At the same time there are hundreds of children and civilians still hiding in tunnels and underground of the #Azovstal steelworks. We urge the world leaders to negotiate a humanitarian corridor and urgent safe evacuation."" The author is drawing a false analogy between the situation in Mariupol and the call for urgent intervention, which oversimplifies the complex geopolitical dynamics at play. 

5. Bandwagon: This fallacy can be observed in the tweet ""RT @EmmanuelMacron À Marioupol, la situation ne fait qu’empirer. Des dizaines de milliers de civils sont piégés. J’appelle une nouvelle fois la Russie à respecter le droit international humanitaire, à permettre aux habitants de quitter la ville, à laisser entrer l’aide humanitaire."" The author is suggesting that because Emmanuel Macron is calling for action, others should follow suit without providing substantial reasoning for this course of action.","- ""SaveMariupol"" and ""SaveUkraineNow"" are cultural cues that indicate a strong sense of solidarity and support for Ukraine.
- ""Azov Regiment"" and ""Azovstal factory"" refer to specific locations or groups within the conflict in Ukraine.
- Mentioning specific political leaders such as @EmmanuelMacron, @POTUS, @OlafSholz, and @RTErdogan implies a call for international intervention and leadership in the context of the conflict.
- References to ""fraternité"" (French for brotherhood) and questioning the idea that Ukrainians and Russians are brothers suggest a cultural stance against Russia and in favor of supporting Ukraine's independence and sovereignty. 
- Mention of economic pressure, raising taxes, and imposing embargoes on Russian businesses indicate a belief in using financial measures to exert pressure on Russia.
