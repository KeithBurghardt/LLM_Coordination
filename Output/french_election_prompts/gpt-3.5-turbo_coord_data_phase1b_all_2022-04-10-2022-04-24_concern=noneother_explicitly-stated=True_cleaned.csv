How on Earth war in Ukraine is not a genocide?"" dismisses the importance of diplomatic efforts and discussions with Russia regarding the war in Ukraine. It implies that such discussions are pointless and not addressing the real issue."
Ukraine,Russia,"Political goal: Provoke international intervention in the conflict, position Russia as an aggressor, and create urgency for closing the sky over Ukraine.","The political goal of this information operation is to create urgency and pressure for European leaders to close the sky over Ukraine, stop Russian aggression, and prevent further humanitarian crises and potential nuclear disaster.",Description: Information operation spreading false information and propaganda to manipulate public opinion and promote a specific agenda related to the conflict in Ukraine.,February,"The major themes from these posts are:

1. Urgent calls for European leaders to close the sky over Ukraine to prevent further atrocities and nuclear disasters caused by Russian attacks.
2. Appeals to stop Putin and Russia's actions in Ukraine to prevent the genocide of the Ukrainian people, specifically children.
3. Criticism of European leaders for their perceived inaction and silence in the face of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.
4. Pleas for international support and assistance to protect the people of Ukraine from Russian aggression.
5. Expressions of outrage and heartbreak over the violence and casualties, particularly the targeting of civilians and children.
6. Calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to prevent further attacks and protect innocent lives.
7. Criticism of the perceived lack of humanity and empathy from world leaders in response to the crisis in Ukraine.","1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy exists in tweets that use emotionally charged language to evoke fear, sadness, and urgency to close the sky over Ukraine. For example, ""How many more children must DIE!? #StopRussia #StopPutin CLOSE THE SKY OVER #UKRAINE! CHILDREN OF THE WHOLE #EUROPE WILL BE NEXT! STOP PUTIN!"" Appeals to emotions can cloud logical reasoning and manipulate individuals into supporting a particular action based on feelings rather than facts.

2. Appeal to Force: This fallacy is present in tweets that repeatedly demand to close the sky over Ukraine using threats or coercion. For example, ""CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE! CHILDREN OF THE WHOLE EUROPE WILL BE NEXT! UNDERSTAND THIS ALREADY! STOP PUTIN NOW!"" This fallacy attempts to influence others through intimidation or fear of consequences rather than presenting a rational argument.

3. Appeal to Popularity: This fallacy is evident in tweets that tag various international leaders and organizations repeatedly to pressure them to close the sky over Ukraine. For example, ""@EmmanuelMacron @vonderleyen @eucopresident @EP_Edinburgh @EU_Commission @Europarl_EN @UN @NATO @OlafScholz @BorisJohnson CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE!"" By appealing to the authority and sheer number of tags, the tweets attempt to gain support and compliance without addressing the actual reasons or consequences of such actions.

4. Appeal to Tradition Wisdom: This fallacy is present in tweets that emphasize the need to close the sky over Ukraine based on the belief that it is the right course of action due to the traditional values or practices of the international community. For example, ""CHILDREN OF UKRAINE ask - #ClosetheSkyoverUkraine! International leaders, listen to our children! OPEN your heart - CLOSE the sky!"" This fallacy relies on the assumption that past practices or beliefs should dictate current decisions without considering new information or circumstances.","The cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts point towards a pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia sentiment. The mentions of European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, Ursula von der Leyen, and other EU and NATO officials suggest an in-group of pro-Western leaders and organizations advocating for action to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression. The use of hashtags like #StopPutin, #StopRussia, and #ClosetheSkyoverUkraine indicate a sense of urgency and a call for international intervention to prevent further atrocities in Ukraine. The mentioning of specific leaders and organizations, as well as the use of multiple languages such as English, Russian, French, and Ukrainian, also suggest a diverse and international in-group united in support of Ukraine.","- Nuclear power plant
