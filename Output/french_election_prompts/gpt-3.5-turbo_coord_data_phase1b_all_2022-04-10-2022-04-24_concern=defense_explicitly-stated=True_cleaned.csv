France,France,"Discrediting opponents, promoting own candidate.",The political goal of the information operation for the posts is to support and promote Marine Le Pen as the preferable candidate for the upcoming election.,"Information operation: Promoting far-right political figures and parties as well as criticizing the current government, particularly Emmanuel Macron, in order to influence public opinion towards a specific political agenda.",April,"- Direct criticism of Emmanuel Macron's management of the Covid pandemic and healthcare policies
- Advocacy for the implementation of a referendum of citizen initiative for political decisions
- Proposals for improving social security and retirement benefits
- Criticism of Macron's refusal to participate in debates and interviews
- Promises to create a Ministry of Rural Affairs and improve living standards for rural areas
- Criticism of media bias and foreign influence in elections
- Acknowledgment of supporters and emphasis on the importance of citizen participation in elections
- Calls for implementing the Referendum of Citizen Initiative and proportional representation in the Assembly.","1. Ad Hominem - The fallacy of Ad Hominem occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than the argument itself. In this example, the tweet from @avecvous calls the individual a psychopath and a charlatan, which is an attack on their character rather than engaging with their argument.

2. Appeal to Tradition - The fallacy of Appeal to Tradition occurs when someone argues that because something has been done a certain way for a long time, it is the correct or best way to do it. In this example, @dupontaignan criticizes Macron's handling of the Covid situation by highlighting changes made, such as the suppression of 17,300 beds, as evidence of a negative development.

3. Appeal to Emotions - The fallacy of Appeal to Emotions occurs when someone attempts to manipulate emotions in order to win an argument. In this example, @MLP_officiel appeals to the emotion of pride and the desire for a fair democratic process by criticizing Macron for refusing to participate in debates.

4. False Dichotomy - The fallacy of False Dichotomy occurs when someone presents a situation as having only two possible outcomes or options when there are actually more. In this example, @JLMelenchon presents the political landscape as divided into three equal blocks, simplifying the complexity of political ideologies and alliances.

5. Straw Man - The fallacy of Straw Man occurs when someone misrepresents their opponent's argument in order to make it easier to attack and refute. In this example, @UPR_Asselineau criticizes Macron for being arrogant and states they will vote for @MLP_officiel, creating a false and exaggerated characterization of Macron's behavior in the debate.","The cultural cues or in-group language used in these posts are primarily related to French political parties and figures. 

- Marine Le Pen is mentioned multiple times, indicating a reference to the far-right National Rally party in France.

- Jean-Luc Mélenchon is mentioned, indicating an association with the left-wing La France Insoumise party.
- Éric Zemmour is mentioned, suggesting a connection to the right-wing political commentator and potential presidential candidate.
- References to Emmanuel Macron indicate an opposition to the current French President and his policies.

Overall, the culture or in-group implied by these posts seems to be centered around French politics, particularly related to the various political parties and figures mentioned, with a focus on the upcoming presidential election and potential policy decisions.

2. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy involves manipulating emotions to win an argument rather than relying on logic or reason. Example: ""@EmmanuelMacron Children in Mariupol live in bombshells and basements for over 50 days. In a completely blocked and for 90% destroyed City.

Ukraine,Russia,The political goal is to call for international support and intervention to close the sky over Ukraine and stop Russian aggression.,The political goal of the information operation is to push for the implementation of a no-fly zone over Ukraine to combat Russian aggression and protect the country from further attacks.,This is a disinformation operation intended to manipulate public opinion about a defense issue in Ukraine.,Month: March,"1.

6. Blame and condemnation for the silence and inaction of European leaders in the face of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine","1. Appeal to Emotions: Several posts use emotional language and imagery to evoke strong emotions and urge action, such as ""How many more children must DIE!?"" and ""We are already burying children in the yards of high-rise buildings. Please, help!"" These appeals to emotion aim to sway the reader's feelings rather than provide logical reasoning.

2. Appeal to Authority: Posts repeatedly tag and call on various leaders and organizations, including Emmanuel Macron, Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO, to take action. This appeal assumes that these authorities have the power to solve the issue and should be relied upon for action.

3. Appeal to Force: Statements like ""STOP PUTIN NOW"" and ""CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE"" use forceful language to command immediate action, appealing to fear and urgency.

4. Misleading Vividness: The posts often include dramatic and vivid descriptions of events, such as ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital"" and ""shooting at civilians' cars."" These details aim to evoke strong emotional responses and may distract from more objective analysis.

5. Straw Man: The posts create a false dichotomy between taking immediate action and being complicit in the violence, as seen in statements like ""How long can you stay away? Are we just a human shield for you?"" This oversimplification of the situation may misrepresent the complex realities at play.","- ""Close the sky over Ukraine!"" is a cultural cue or in-group language used in these posts, implying a sense of urgency and a call for action. The culture or in-group implied by these posts is likely individuals who are concerned about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and are advocating for international intervention to protect Ukrainian citizens.
- The use of hashtags such as #StopPutin, #StopRussia, and #ClosetheSkyoverUkraine also indicate a specific group of people who are against Russian aggression and support measures to protect Ukraine.
- Mentioning European leaders, NATO, and other international organizations in the posts suggests an in-group of individuals who are engaged in discussions about defense strategies and alliances in the context of the Ukraine conflict.
- The appeals to save children and prevent further atrocities imply a shared value system within this in-group, prioritizing the protection of innocent lives and condemning violence.","- Europe has to wake up
