France.,France.,Anti-refugee sentiment.,"Political goal: Promote anti-immigration sentiments, support tighter border control, oppose refugee acceptance.",Refugee misinformation operation.,Starting month: October,"The major themes from the posts include:
- Immigration and the challenges it poses to national identity and security
- Support for border control measures and protection of national borders
- Different approaches to handling refugees, with some advocating for temporary protection and assistance, while others emphasize the need for deportations and stricter immigration policies
- Criticism of current government policies and actions related to refugee acceptance and immigration management

Overall, the posts highlight the ongoing debate and differing viewpoints regarding refugee policies and immigration control in Europe.","1. Appeal to Emotions: This fallacy is present in the tweet from Emmanuel Macron, where he highlights the support provided to Ukrainian refugees in France, appealing to emotions to gain support and sympathy.

Example: ""À ce jour, plus de 15 000 réfugiés venus d’Ukraine sont arrivés en France. Ils bénéficient de la protection temporaire. Nous leur proposons un hébergement ainsi qu’un accompagnement social, administratif et sanitaire.""

2. Ad Hominem: This fallacy is apparent in the tweets from Zemmour, where he criticizes Emmanuel Macron's policies and decisions regarding immigration without presenting valid arguments but attacking his character instead.

Example: ""E. Macron, voici la terrible histoire que je racontais dans mon discours : celle d’Evelyne qui a perdu son fils massacré par un réfugié soudanais. Écoutez son témoignage plutôt que dire votre mépris pour les victimes et la colère des Français, avec votre arrogance habituelle.""

3. False Dichotomy: This fallacy is seen in the tweets from Zemmour and other politicians, where they present the issue of immigration as a black and white scenario without acknowledging the complexities and nuances of the topic.

Example: ""Je veux accueillir temporairement les réfugiés ukrainiens qui sont nos frères européens et chrétiens. Je ne veux pas que des immigrés africains profitent de cela, comme c’est déjà le cas.""

4. Loaded Language: This fallacy is present in the tweets from Zemmour, where he uses emotionally charged and biased language to manipulate readers' opinions and create a negative perception of immigrants and immigration policies.

Example: ""Emmanuel Macron a fait rentrer deux millions d’immigrés pendant son quinquennat. Moi, j’expulserai un million d’étrangers délinquants, criminels et fichés S.""","Cultural cues and in-group language used in these posts include terms like ""frontière espagnole"" (Spanish border), ""immigration venue du Sud"" (immigration from the South), ""Réfugiés ukrainiens"" (Ukrainian refugees), ""fichés S"" (S-listed individuals), ""immigrés africains"" (African immigrants), ""demandezleprogramme"" (ask for the program), ""migrants,"" ""contrôle aux frontières"" (border control), ""clandestins"" (clandestine migrants) among others.

The culture or in-group implied by these posts is one that is concerned with issues related to immigration, refugees, border control, and national identity. These posts reflect a perspective that emphasizes the need for stricter immigration policies, prioritizing the protection of national borders and security, and expressing skepticism or opposition towards the influx of refugees from certain regions, particularly Africa and the Middle East. The language used suggests a nationalist and anti-immigration stance, advocating for measures such as deportations, border security enhancements, and the prioritization of certain groups of refugees over others.","- immigration

Condemnation of European appeasement policies towards aggressors
2. Urgent need for heavy weapons to support Ukraine in fighting for freedom and preventing refugees
3. Appeal for international unity and leadership to protect children and civilians in war-torn areas","1. Appeal to Emotions: The posts are attempting to evoke strong emotions from the reader by highlighting the suffering of children and refugees in Mariupol and framing the issue as a matter of life and freedom. The repeated use of emotional language and imagery is intended to sway the reader's opinion based on feelings rather than logic or evidence.

Example Post: ""Children in Mariupol live in bombshells for over 50 days. In a completely blocked and for 90% destroyed City. Only internationally united guarantees from the world community and leaders can help those children to survive. Don’t let them die, like 205 others and thousands injured.""

2. Bandwagon: The posts repeatedly call for giving weapons to Ukraine in order to prevent the need for giving money for refugees. This creates a sense of urgency and implies that supporting this action is the popular or correct choice, appealing to the idea of joining a cause that many others are already supporting.

Example Post: ""Give weapons for Ukraine and you won't need to give money for refugees! Ukrainians have their home. We need heavy weapons right now. It is the matter not only of our lives and freedom. Ukraine is fighting for the whole Europe now! #ArmUkraineNow""

3. Appeal to Traditional Wisdom: The posts suggest that providing heavy weapons to Ukraine is a solution rooted in traditional wisdom or common practice. By framing the argument in this way, it attempts to make the proposed action seem like a logical and time-tested response to the situation.

Example Post: ""Give weapons for Ukraine and you won't need to give money for refugees! Ukrainians have their home. We need heavy weapons right now. It is a matter of our lives and freedom. Ukraine is fighting for the whole of Europe now! #ArmUkraineNow""","The cultural cues and in-group language being used in these posts imply a sense of solidarity with and support for Ukraine. The hashtag #ArmUkraineNow suggests a call for action to arm Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. The emphasis on Ukrainians having their home and the plea for heavy weapons to ensure their lives and freedom indicate a strong sense of national identity and unity among supporters of Ukraine. The mention of Mariupol, a city under siege, and the urgent call for international support to prevent further suffering of civilians also highlight the humanitarian aspect of the conflict and the need for global solidarity. The repeated use of the hashtag #ArmUkraineNow and the direct appeal to political leaders such as Charles Michel and Emmanuel Macron suggest an in-group of individuals who are actively advocating for Ukraine's cause on social media. The overall tone of the posts conveys a sense of urgency, desperation, and a plea for immediate action to prevent further humanitarian crisis and refugee influx into Europe.","1. Gratefulness to the French people for shelter

For example, the post that mentions how children in Mariupol are living in bomb shelters for over 50 days and highlights the destruction and blockage of the city, emphasizes the need for internationally united guarantees from world leaders to help those children survive.

These posts encourage the topic-group to continue discussing the issue and to take action in support of Ukraine.,"The posts that use a Distort tactic are the ones that focus more on the urgency of providing weapons to Ukraine, rather than solely on the issue of refugees. While providing weapons may be a part of the solution to the conflict in Ukraine, the main topic of these posts should be the refugees and the need for international support to address their plight. By heavily emphasizing the need for weapons, these posts are altering the main message of the topic.","The posts using a Dismay tactic are:

- ""Mariupol city council reports deaths of hunger in the city. Says many are starving. This is happening in Europe now. The Russians surrounded the city. Do not miss the humanitarian convoy. Refugees are not released. Don’t tell me that the world can’t do more to prevent this.""

- ""Children in Mariupol live in bombshells for over 50 days. In a completely blocked and for 90% destroyed City. Only internationally united guarantees from the world community a d leaders can help those children to survive. Don’t let them die, like 205 others and thousands injured.""
