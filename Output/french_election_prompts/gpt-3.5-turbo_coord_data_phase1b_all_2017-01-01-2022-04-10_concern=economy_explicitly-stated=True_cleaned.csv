There are also mentions of specific policies and proposals to address economic challenges such as increasing salaries, lowering taxes, and investigating corruption.","The cause of the problem mentioned in these tweets is the economic policies, decisions, and management of the French government under President Emmanuel Macron. This includes issues such as tax increases, wealth inequality, government spending on consulting firms, favoritism towards billionaires, and potential corruption. The tweets also suggest a lack of transparency and accountability in economic decision-making, leading to concerns about the distribution of wealth, the impact on businesses, and the overall economy in France.","The remedies explicitly or alluded to in these posts include:

1. Lowering the VAT on energy and fuel from 20% to 5.5% to alleviate the burden on motorists.
2. Implementing measures to increase purchasing power, such as reducing the VAT on energy and fuel to 5.5% and returning an average of 150 to 200 euros per month to French households.
3. Implementing a 10% increase in salaries by freezing the additional employer contributions to address low wages in France.
4. Advocating for a wealth tax and a minimum wage increase to address wealth inequality and the concentration of wealth in the hands of billionaires.
5. Advocating for a revolution in tax policy to ensure that 92% of families earning less than 4000 euros per month pay less in income tax, promoting fiscal justice.
6. Investigating potential corruption and undue influence by consulting firms like McKinsey in shaping economic policies and decisions.
7. Supporting policies to ensure food security, such as free school meals, to address the issue of 8 million people relying on food aid.
8. Promoting agricultural policies that allow farmers to earn a decent living from their work and resist the state's excessive interference in personal finances.","1. The VAT on energy and fuel being lowered from 20% to 5.5% is described as a measure to ""soulager les automobilistes"" (relieve motorists), suggesting a metaphorical burden on French consumers due to high taxes on energy and fuel.

2. The suspension of the sale of foreign currencies by the Russian central bank is described as ridiculing the narrative of Western leaders, including Biden, Macron, and Von der Leyen, who celebrated the ""effondrement de l'économie russe"" (collapse of the Russian economy), portraying it as a deflating balloon, implying a sense of exaggeration and misinformation.

3. The increase in fortunes of billionaires under Macron's economic policies is metaphorically described as the ""ruissellement"" (trickling down) of wealth, indicating that the benefits of economic growth primarily flowed to the wealthiest individuals and families, like trickling water.

4. Macron's fascination with consulting firms like McKinsey is described as ""ruineux"" (ruinous) and ""calamiteux"" (calamitous), suggesting that his preference for these firms has led to disastrous consequences for the French economy, akin to a shipwreck.

5. The proposal for an ""impôt sur les profiteurs de crise"" (tax on crisis profiteers) is metaphorically likened to sharing the wealth, suggesting a redistribution of financial gains made during times of crisis.

6. The concept of increasing the minimum wage to 1400 euros net and advocating for a wealth tax is positioned as a response to the ""vie chère"" (expensive life), conveying the idea of financial struggles and high costs of living for ordinary people in France.

7. The accusation of McKinsey engaging in false testimonies before a Senate inquiry is described as shedding light on the ""McKinseyGate"" scandal, invoking a sense of a potential cover-up or wrongdoing that needs to be exposed.

These metaphors serve to vividly illustrate the economic challenges, policies, and potential solutions discussed in the tweets, helping to engage readers and convey complex ideas in a more relatable manner.","Catchphrases related to the problem, cause, and remedy mentioned in the tweets include:

The second post, however, does not use an Explain tactic, as it focuses on criticizing the leadership in Uganda and the alleged support from the EU, without providing specific details or elaboration on economic impacts.","The first post from @EmmanuelMacron elicits a positive emotion by emphasizing the opportunity for two countries to strengthen their relationship and collaborate on new projects. This post uses an Excite tactic to elicit a positive emotion of joy or excitement. The second post, however, focuses on violent attacks and political unrest in Uganda and does not use an Excite tactic.","The first tweet from @EmmanuelMacron uses an Enhance tactic by highlighting potential collaborations between France and Argentina in areas such as energy transition, clean energy, culture, education, and defense. This encourages the topic-group to continue discussing and exploring opportunities for economic cooperation between the two countries. 

The second tweet does not use an Enhance tactic as it focuses on criticizing the actions of a specific leader in Uganda and calling for an end to impunity, rather than encouraging further discussion or collaboration on the topic of economy.",The second post uses a Distort tactic by shifting the focus from the main topic of economy and the agreement between France and Argentina to accusations of violent attacks on democratic processes in Uganda. This post alters the main message of the topic by introducing a separate issue.,The second post uses a Dismay tactic by pointing out the violent attacks on democratic processes in Uganda and blaming the EU for funding the despot responsible for them. This elicits negative emotions such as anger and sadness.,"The second tweet is using a distract tactic. Instead of discussing the topic of the economy, which is the focus of the coordinated campaign, the tweet brings up the violent attacks on democratic processes in Uganda and criticizes the EU for allegedly funding the government. This is a completely different topic and serves to divert attention away from the main focus on economic issues.
